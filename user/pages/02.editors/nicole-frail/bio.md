##### Bio

Nicole Frail has more than fifteen years of professional publishing experience, with twelve of those spent with a trade publisher based in New York City. She is now the owner of Nicole Frail Edits, LLC, an editing agency that performs various levels of editing for private clients ranging from imprints of big-five publishers to indie authors. She also launched Nicole Frail Books, LLC in late 2024, which is a (super) small independent press that blends the values of traditional and indie publishing and is dedicated to bringing as many new voices to press as possible through projects such as anthologies and short story ebooks. She currently lives outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania, with her husband and three little boys.

**Pronouns: She/Her**

##### MSWL

I’d be **thrilled** to work with:
* Middle grade and young adult fiction (all of it; I love it)
* Sweet romance (a little spice is okay, but closed door is preferred)
* LGBTQ voices
* Contemporary / “Women’s” fiction
* Light fantasy / Light science fiction
* Cozy mysteries

Bonus points if it’s dual or multi POV! But not necessary.

I would **not** be a good fit for:
* Literary fiction
* Military fiction / Military science fiction
* Hard science fiction
* Super spicy romance / Dark romance
* Anything that is part poetry

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I appreciate being dropped right into some sort of action—not necessarily a fight or a character running for their lives, but some sort of defining moment that grips me and makes me want to know how the MC found themselves in this position. Avoiding info dumping is key in those first few pages, as well.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Email is my main form of communication. I usually hide away with the manuscripts I work on; I don't offer a lot of updates or check-ins. I like to for the author to hold all questions and comments until I've been able to read through it, think on it, and then deliver. Then we chat. :)

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

For developmental/content edits, I don't touch the document beyond leaving comments in the margins. I believe the revision process is the perfect time to learn about writing and to brush up on your skills (and learn new ones!), so all of the actual revision work is done by the author. I'll absolutely offer ideas and provide feedback on revisions, but the author has to implement them. I love working with authors who are open to feedback and who aren't afraid to ask questions if they don't totally understand what I've recommended or referenced. But I will not rewrite your work for you.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I own two new-ish small businesses and have three little boys under the age of eight, so I don't have many hobbies... but I do like to read, drink coffee, and play tabletop boardgames with my husband when I'm not on a deadline.
