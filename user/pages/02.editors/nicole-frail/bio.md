##### MSWL

**I’d be thrilled to work with:**
* Middle grade and young adult fiction (all of it; I love it)
* Sweet romance (a little spice is okay, but closed door is preferred)
* LGBTQ voices
* Contemporary / “Women’s” fiction
* Light fantasy / Light science fiction
* Cozy mysteries
* Bonus points if it’s dual or multi POV! But not necessary. 

**I would not be a good fit for:**
* Literary fiction
* Military fiction / Military science fiction
* Hard science fiction
* Super spicy romance / Dark romance
* Anything that is part poetry

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I appreciate being dropped right into some sort of action—not necessarily a fight or a character running for their lives, but some sort of defining moment that grips me and makes me want to know how the MC found themselves in this position. Avoiding info dumping is key in those first few pages, as well.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Email is my main form of communication since I do most of my work late at night and on weekends; I don't expect anyone to be able to hop on the phone at 11 p.m. just because I can. I usually hide away with the manuscripts I work on; I don't offer a lot of updates or check-ins. I like to hold all questions and comments until I've been able to read through it, think on it, and then deliver. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

For developmental/content edits, I don't touch the document beyond leaving comments in the margins. I believe the revision process is the perfect time to learn about writing and to brush up on your skills (and learn new ones!), so all of the actual revision work is done by the author. I'll absolutely offer ideas and provide feedback on revisions, but the author has to implement them. I love working with authors who are open to feedback and who aren't afraid to ask questions if they don't totally understand what I've recommended or referenced. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Reading, of course! If I'm not working or reading, I'm playing with my three little boys. We like to shop, bake, and dance in the kitchen. :)
