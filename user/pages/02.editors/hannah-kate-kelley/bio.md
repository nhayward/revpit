##### MSWL

Writers may submit a manuscript below 110,000 words in any fiction genre, including MG, YA, and Adult.

I am not currently accepting non-fiction, creative nonfiction, memoir, poetry, or children's stories younger than MG.

I read widely, and my clients' manuscripts reflect that. Some of my favorite subgenres include (but are not limited to) Gothic horror in non-Western or atypical settings, queer anything, nail-biting domestic thrillers and literary fiction, steamy New Adult romance, epic historical fantasies, and dystopian adventures reminiscent of the 2010s.

A few of my favorite titles include:
* anything by Tamora Pierce
* CIRCE by Madeline Miller
* FOURTH WING by Rebecca Yarros
* JANE EYRE by Charlotte Brontë
* MEXICAN GOTHIC by Silvia Moreno-Garcia
* RED, WHITE & ROYAL BLUE by Casey McQuiston
* SUCH A FUN AGE by Kiley Reid
* TWILIGHT by Stephanie Meyer
* YELLOWFACE by R. F. Kuang

I am actively seeking stories written by women, queer, trans, POC, disabled, and neurodivergent writers.

When it comes to spice level, I'm comfortable with everything from sweet to dark romance. If your story has sensitive content, feel free to include a content warning, but I do not require one.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

Within the first five pages, I want to feel something for the protagonist. Nothing too major, and I don't need to know their entire life story. But if they're facing a nettlesome conflict in the first chapter? Then I want to feel their brewing frustration. I want to know what they want in life, or at least what they want in this scene, and how they're struggling to get it.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

My winner gets a full manuscript evaluation on their novel, including thorough feedback on their story's title and length, market positioning, genre conventions, character development, plot, structure, POV, writing style, and pacing. The purpose of this edit is to help you uncover what is working well, what could work better, and how to strengthen your story with actionable steps.

Here's what you get in a manuscript evaluation with me:
* Editorial Letter: A clear, actionable set of directives you can take into the revision process that will tighten up your story step-by-step.
* Developmental Edit: Constructive and kind in-line comments on your first three chapters (or first 6,000 words) to see what’s working at the scene-level.
* Follow-Up Call: A 1:1 with yours truly to discuss any feedback questions or new ideas. You’ll leave with a clear idea of next steps.
* Extra Resources: Additional workbooks, writing materials, and other resources personalized for you and your story.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

After my winner receives their feedback, you'll get a few days to read through and process everything. During this time, my writers typically unlock a well of new ideas for tweaking their stories. Jot these down and embrace the brainstorming sessions.

On our 1:1 call, please bring a list of questions and discussion points. I'll let you lead the call or I can walk us through the highest-level edits--whatever you prefer. By the end, you should have a clear plan for revision work.

Even after our call, I'm available by email to offer clarification on my feedback and will be checking in every few months to see how you and your writing are faring.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

When not working with writers (or writing my own stories), you can find me drawing, getting lost on hikes, or running my adult soccer league. And every month, I like to try something new, so I've just signed up for line-dancing classes!
