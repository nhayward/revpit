##### MSWL

In **YA**, I am looking for a good contemporary, romance, fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian, or suspense/thriller novel.

In **New Adult:** Romance, fantasy, or suspense.

In **Adult:** Romance (including romantic suspense).
 
Diverse voices? YES, please. I am Open. To. It. All.

Personal tastes: Love-triangles still tickle me, anything set in Los Angeles, the west coast, or abandoned locations, and retellings (from fairytales to mythology).  Also, I love snarky voices and dark humor. I like characters with edge and who are unapologetic about who they are, but can back it up (and are redeemable).

I will **not** be interested in: Paranormal, Historical, Middle Grade fiction, or anything over 120k words.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

 * Voice is _key_. I want to be convinced to follow this character anywhere they take me. I need to care about their plight.
 * Pages begin in the right place, which is usually _in media res_ (in the middle of things). I don’t need a dead body, but I do need a clear indication that the inciting incident is super nearby, if not currently taking place.
 * Strong grasp of writing mechanics, especially Show Don’t Tell.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

 * You can expect to work with someone who is excited to see you reach your writing goals. I want to do all I can to help get you there. I hope to encourage you, get you excited to plow through the tough spots, and see you grow as a writer. I will help you dig deep to pull out the parts of your story that are hiding, and make your manuscript shine.
 * Once it’s announced we are working together, I’d like to have a phone call. We’ll chat about the book, your goals, your struggles, and what you can expect in working together. I am your person to turn to. I am committed to your book (and your career as a writer). You will not be alone in this process.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Open communication. Respect. We are both going to put in a lot of time and effort in this manuscript, and I don’t take it lightly. I hope you won’t either. I will work with your vision and help you take it there, but I do not expect you to agree with every suggestion I make. I do expect that we can have discussions about suggestions or questions, and work together to do what the story is requiring of us. Also, I hope you like exclamation points! I will use them in _every_ email. It’s how I convey enthusiasm. I would love to see them (or your own method of enthusiasm) in return! But fair warning, I’ll still chop them out of your MS.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I’m that person who gets super motivated about trying new things. I’ll research a ton, get all the supplies, and then I’ll ultimately never have the time to follow through. Most recently, that’s been cross-stitching. Before that was bullet journaling. Calligraphy is next—the supplies are sitting in my Amazon prime cart.

**What was your favorite childhood book and what did you love about it?**

I can immediately think of a favorite book for different moments in my childhood. I discovered new things about myself and who I wanted to be through books. Can I break the rules here, please?
 * Pre-School/Elementary: _I’ll Love You Forever_
 * Middle school: _Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret_
 * High school: _Perks of Being a Wallflower_. But also… _Running with Scissors_
