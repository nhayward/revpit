She's a featured editor for Revise & Resub (#RevPit contest) and #ShoreIndie contest (2017). Katie has judged the 2016 & 2015 Golden Hearts Awards and 2014 Stiletto Contest.

***What kind of entries are you looking for in this contest?***

I love character-driven stories. Tension between love interests, best-friends, and/or parents & children. I love reading about two people falling in love despite how much they disliked each other to start. I do enjoy a good love triangle. I can get behind an unlikeable character, as long as they are compelling, show room for growth, and have a Save the Cat! moment(s). Interested in unique & diverse voices.
 
What I hope to see in my #RevPit submission box:
 
 * Adult: Romance—Contemporary, Suspense

 * YA & NA: Romance, Contemporary, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Dystopian
 
_Not_ interested in: Historical, Erotica (different than erotic romance), Epic or Dark fantasy, MG or younger.

***What is your background in editing?***

KM Editorial, LLC was established in 2012. Since then, I’ve worked with new writers, indie authors, and publishing houses. Some of my authors have been repped by agents, and a few others have won awards.

***What can writers expect from working with you during the contest?***

I put all I have into each book I work on. I want to see my authors (and _all_ authors at that!) succeed. For the writer I work with, I’ll be invested in them and their book. I’ll dig deep to provide feedback that is constructive, but encouraging. My goal is to help push my writers to tell their stories even better than they knew they could.

***What do you expect from writers during the contest revision process?***

I expect a writer to be excited about the process, even if it’s new to them. To be open to feedback, but also not the type to blanket-accept all suggestions. It’s important that a writer knows their work and their voice. I do not expect a writer to agree with 100% of my suggestions, but I do want them to be willing to understand why a suggestion has been made and how to best address it in their voice, their way, in order to tell the strongest story they can. I like to provide the spark that ignites a writer’s flame.

***What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?***

I live to work, so the rare times I am doing something that isn’t writing, reading, editing, or thinking about writing, reading, and editing, I’m probably watching something on The CW or exploring Los Angeles.

***What three books would you save in a dystopian future where libraries are banned?***

 * _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_
 * _Running with Scissors_
 * _Pride & Prejudice_
