##### MSWL

I am all about character-driven stories. I love voices with a bite, characters with strong convictions, and a world that grips me from page one. 

I usually lean toward stories with romance, and I’ll still be happy to see those, but this year I’m also in the mood for something gritty. I want that manuscript that takes things a little further, maybe even gets a little darker, and explores the many layers of a person and their relationships. 

Diverse voices? YES, please.

Breakdown:
 * YA, NA, Adult
 * Contemporary, women’s fiction, romance, fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian, mystery, suspense, thriller.
 * I will **not** be accepting: historical fiction, historical fantasy, middle grade fiction, space opera, erotica, or stories that include ghosts, shape-shifting, dragons, demons, angels, rape, or suicide.
 * I will **not** consider anything over 120k words.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

 * Voice is _key_. I want to be convinced to follow this character anywhere they take me. I need to care about their plight.
 * Pages begin in the right place.
 * A vivid world: I want to feel inserted into the story, setting, and vibe immediately. 
 * Strong grasp of writing mechanics, especially Show Don’t Tell and Deep POV.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

 * You can expect to work with someone who is excited to see you reach your writing goals. I want to do all I can to help get you there. I hope to encourage you, get you excited to plow through the tough spots, and see you grow as a writer. I will help you dig deep to pull out the parts of your story that are hiding and make your manuscript shine.
 * Once it’s announced we are working together, I’d like to have a phone call. We’ll chat about the book, your goals, your struggles, and what you can expect in working together. I am your person. I am committed to your book (and your career as a writer). You will not be alone in this process.


**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Open communication. Respect. We are both going to put in a lot of time and effort in this manuscript, and I don’t take it lightly. I hope you won’t either. I will work with your vision and help you take it there, but I do not expect you to agree with every suggestion I make. I do expect that we can have discussions about suggestions or questions, and work together to do what the story is requiring of us. Also, I hope you like exclamation points! I will use them in _every_ email. It’s how I convey enthusiasm. I would love to see them (or your own method of enthusiasm) in return! But fair warning, I’ll still chop them out of your MS.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I enjoy cross-stitching, although I like teaching myself so most creations turn out…interesting to say the least. I write romance, “read” on walks, re-binge favorite shows (The Vampire Diaries, Brothers & Sisters, Parks & Rec), and listen to the Big Little Lies soundtrack over and over.

**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

I loved _The Kiss Quotient_. The voice is so pure and captivating! It’s a contemporary romance with an unconventional set-up (think Pretty Woman gender swap) and the heroine is refreshing and real. It’s also an #ownvoices novel; the author opens our eyes to characters with autism.
