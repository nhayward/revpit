##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

When I connect with the character, I connect with the story. Let me experience the main character’s emotions, decisions, and circumstances _with_ them. I want a clear POV that jumps right into what is happening in their world as the MC continues their journey.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

You can expect a partnership. We’ll start by discussing your major concerns and questions via our chosen method(s) of communication. My goal is to help you perfect the story you’ve envisioned while keeping your voice. My focus during the first round of developmental editing is the big picture content like world-building, character development, action, pace, and plotting. You’ll receive comprehensive feedback and suggested changes using comments and track changes with Word. After you’ve made revisions, I’ll complete another round to review the changes and provide more feedback. We’ll also polish the query letter and first five pages together for the showcase.

My preferred methods of communication are social media and email. I will not do video chats or phone calls.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Open communication, responsiveness, and respect are essential. If you have questions, ask! If you have concerns, voice them! If you do not want to make a particular change, tell me! This is your baby, and I expect you to protect it fiercely while also allowing it to change and grow.

Prepare to make significant revisions in a limited amount of time, including cutting, adding, and reshaping. I expect you to work as hard, dedicate as much time, and lose as much sleep during the time we have together as I do.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love napping, bugging my cat for pets, playing video games, reading, and watching TV.

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

_The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_ by Stephen King because it feels like home. I read it in my teen years and connected with the main character’s perseverance despite her circumstances.
