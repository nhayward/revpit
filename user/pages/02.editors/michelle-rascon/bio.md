##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

When a manuscript gives me a reason to connect with the character immediately, I ultimately connect with the story. Introduce me to the main character while lightly immersing me into the scene and let me experience events along with the character. I need a clear POV and I need the inciting incident to become invested. Leaving me wanting more by the end of the first chapter is a surefire way to win me over.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

You can expect a partnership. We’ll start with discussing your major concerns and questions via our chosen method(s) of communication. The first round of editing is a high-level assessment of the manuscript including comprehensive feedback using comments and track changes with Word. During the first round, we may not have much feedback to discuss until you receive the manuscript back, so it’s a great time to ask questions in real-time and gather as much information from me as possible. My goal is to complete two rounds of developmental editing on the full manuscript and polish the first five pages plus query letter for the showcase. My preferred methods of communication are social media and email.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

To receive the most out of your win, we need to have continuous and productive communication within the five weeks we work together. If you have questions, ask! If you have concerns, voice them! If you do not want to make a particular change, tell me! This is your baby, and I expect you to protect it fiercely while also allowing it to change and grow into what you want. Prepare yourself to make major changes in a limited amount of time. I expect you to work as hard, dedicate as much time, and lose as much sleep during these five weeks as I do.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Is napping a hobby? I love a good nap. I also enjoy petting and cuddling with my cat, Ricochet. YouTube, Hearthstone, and Hulu are my go-to activities when I’m not working. Aside from spending time with my husband and son, of course.

**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

_Nice Girls Don’t Bite Their Neighbors (Half-Moon Hollow Series)_ by Molly Harper. This is the fourth (and presumed final) book in the Jane Jameson series, and I’ve never read a series faster. The characters are distinct, quirky, and fun. The suspenseful whodunit of the plot kept me invested. The romance was realistic, steamy, and entertaining.
