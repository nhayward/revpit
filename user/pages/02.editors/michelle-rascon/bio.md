Please **do not** send anything to do with car accidents, even minor scenes, including backstory. **No exceptions**. (If in doubt, please choose another editor.) I am also not accepting epic or high fantasy, Christian fiction, historical anything, magical realism, military-based, sci-fi, or speculative fiction for this contest. I am not limiting my word count this year, but it should be within or close to publishing standards for the genre.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Open with the character(s) promised in the query letter. Give me a deep POV that lets me experience what the character is experiencing instead of telling me what the character is experiencing. I want a sense of who the main character is, where they are in their life, where they are going, and what they're risking. Show me that you know how to create a scene and understand the basics of the craft. Leave me wanting more.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

My preferred methods of communication are email and social media chats. I do not offer video calls or phone calls.

We'll start by discussing your major concerns about the manuscript and the aspects you feel work well. Then, I'll read the full manuscript and write an editorial letter highlighting the strengths, opportunities, recommended revisions, and the next steps you should consider. We’ll have a follow-up chat to discuss any clarifications needed so you can get to work on revisions. We'll also polish your query letter and first five pages together for the showcase. I'll be available for brainstorming and support throughout the entire process, and I hope for long after!

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Mutual, open communication, responsiveness, and respect are essential to a positive working relationship. I expect you to ask questions, voice your concerns, and refuse to make certain subjective changes. Your book is your baby, and I want you to protect it fiercely while also allowing it to adjust and grow. I also expect you to work at least as hard as I will.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Sometimes I squeeze in a TBR book or an audiobook. The kid and I go for walks on most weekdays. I practice yoga and lift weights. I listen to music. Sometimes I play video games. The hubs and I watch TV or movies on weekend nights. Occasionally, we play board games or watch TV as a family. I also find a way to annoy my cat every day.

**What was your favorite show to binge watch in the last year?**

_The Queen's Gambit_.
