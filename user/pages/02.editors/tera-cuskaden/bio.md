##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

The first thing that always strikes me when I open a book is the voice. I want to be immersed in a writer’s voice and drawn immediately into the world they’ve created. I want to be cemented in the scene and the characters without too much exposition. I want to have an inkling of why we’re here in this place with these characters, and I want those characters to jump off the page. I’m looking for escape; if you can make me escape, you’ve snagged a new reader. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

My goal is you, your vision, and your success. I want to enable you to be the best storyteller you can be by helping you mold your characters, your plot, your scenes, and your GMCs. We’ll first look at developmental, larger-picture issues and I’ll assess your pages. After I give you that feedback and we’ve worked to implement that, if we have time we’ll work on line edits and I’ll show you how you can hone your voice further. I typically answer emails within forty-eight hours, and Sundays are the day I take to myself and try not to get online at all. If you haven’t heard from me in forty-eight hours, send me a nudge!

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Communication is important, and I want you to be excited about the process. Checking email is important, because the longer it takes you to get back to me, the less time we have to work on your pages. I want to ensure you’re getting the most out of the process with the limited time we have, so punctuality is important, though I don’t expect or want you to skip important events and not practice your own form of self-care. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I don’t write. I know, I know. I spend that time reading and knitting instead. I love knitting. Knitting and binging Netflix is my biggest form of self-care other than spending time with my husband and my herd of cats (no, really, I have a herd of them. I believe the proper term is a clowder). And my family and friends are super important to me, so I make sure to carve time out of my week to spend time with them.

**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

There were so many! One of my favorite books I read in 2018 was _The Belles_ by Dhonielle Clayton. The lush prose and worldbuilding sucked me right in, and I was entranced. I loved the deeper message about the price of beauty, and I’ve been waiting with bated breath for the second book, _Everlasting Rose_ (which I purchased today!).
