##### Bio

I’m an Ohio-girl living in Pennsylvania with my handsome hubby, two hilarious and perfect kids, a crazy cat, and a killer newt. I graduated from Ohio Dominican University with a BA in English and Language arts all the way back in 2007. Rainy days are my favorite, food makes me happy, and I am terrible at small talk. In addition to editing, I write YA books about contemporary pranksters and historical pirates.

***What kind of entries are you looking for in this contest?***

I am on the hunt for MG and YA manuscripts!

I’d love to see any genre within those age groups EXCEPT for science fiction. (I’m not as passionate about sci-fi, so another editor might be a better fit.)

FAIR WARNING: If I make a request for pages, I’m going to ask for your synopsis and full MS to help me decide!

MSWL:
 * Antiheroes 
 * Strong friendships/groups 
 * Humor, sarcasm, quirkiness everywhere! 
 * Foodies
 * Hate turned to love 
 * Dark twists 
 * Heists 
 * Dancing

***What is your background in editing?***

I’ve been a freelance editor for almost two years, participated as an editor for past Pitch to Publication contests, and interned at Entangled Teen for a year. I’m also a YA writer, so the art of revision is very near and dear to my heart.

***What can writers expect from working with you during the contest?***

I love getting to work with authors and have had a great time bonding with my past partners! For our month together, expect to have some fun and work really hard! I’ll take a few days to go through your manuscript, giving you an edit letter and in-line notes. We’ll brainstorm, probably quote movies, and get really good at our GIF game. Once you’ve started on your revisions, I’ll be ready with pep talks and cheer you through the process until you’re ready to go with a polished and fabulous story!

***What do you expect from writers during the contest revision process?***

Because we’re on a bit of a deadline, I expect priority to be placed on your revisions. I know life happens, and I certainly don’t expect you to ditch your families and careers—but you’ll need to make sure you’ve got a significant amount of time to commit to this process. I’m a big fan of communication, so I’d really appreciate being kept in the loop throughout our time together.

***What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?***

I am obsessed with Dancing with the Stars, comedy sitcoms and movies, and pinning stuff on Pinterest I’ll most likely never do in real life. I go for long walks and daydream until my head hurts, and I am at my most content while dining out at a restaurant. I love spending an afternoon playing with my two crazy kids and our fuzzy kitten Izzy.

***What three books would you save in a dystopian future where libraries are banned?***

This is a tough one, since so many of my favorite books are in a series. I’d have to say that I’d grab my Bible, _Pride and Prejudice_ (unless my Jane Austen anthology counts as one book?), and any Pete the Cat story I could get my hands on.
