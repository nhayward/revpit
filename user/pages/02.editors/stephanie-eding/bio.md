##### Bio

Stephanie Eding graduated with an English degree from Ohio Dominican University in 2007. She began freelance editing three years ago and interned with Entangled Publishing for one year. Stephanie loves participating in writing contests and has been an editor for both Pitch to Publication and Revise and Resub.

Living in Ohio with her zany husband and two child comedians, Stephanie loves to laugh and quotes movies at inappropriate times. Stephanie also writes young adult fiction to satisfy her wild imagination. Her first book, UNANCHORED, comes out with Anaiah Press in April!

Stephanie loves coffee, rainstorms, Lindsey Stirling, and volunteers at the local humane society. She frequently gets distracted by her three wild-eyed cats who double as unhelpful office assistants.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I want to connect with the character right away, and a strong voice will hook me every time! Humor in the everyday will always catch my attention. I’d love to see strong writing and feel part of the story.
 
**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

In the first week, you’ll get an edit letter from me that points out big picture suggestions. I’ll also make in-text comments as I read and point out some ways to strengthen sentence structures and writing. I will be available throughout the month to toss around ideas, and we’ll work together to polish your query and first pages to prepare you for submission.
 
**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect my writer to work hard during our time together. I would love to be kept in the loop throughout the editing process and want my writer to return all materials on time.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?** 

Food is one of the greatest loves of my life, and I love nothing more than to go out to a restaurant where I don’t have to cook or clean it up. I am always lost in the middle of a good TV series (currently _Seinfeld_), and I am borderline obsessed with _Dancing with the Stars_.
 
**What was your favorite childhood book and what did you love about it?**

This is tough. We had a huge collection of classics that had been made into children’s books. I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE over and over again. I was obsessed with the regency era and just loved Elizabeth as a sassy main character (and coincidentally named my daughter after her)!
