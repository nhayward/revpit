##### Bio

Stephanie Eding graduated with an English degree from Ohio Dominican University in 2007. She began freelance editing four years ago, interned with Entangled Publishing, and currently acquires middle grade manuscripts as a senior editor at Anaiah Press. 

Living in Ohio with her zany husband and two child comedians, Stephanie maintains her fluency in sarcasm and movie quotes. She also writes young adult fiction to satisfy her wild imagination. Her first book, UNANCHORED, came out in 2018.

Stephanie loves coffee, rainstorms, afternoon naps, and volunteers at the local humane society. She frequently gets distracted by her six wild-eyed cats who double as unhelpful office assistants.
