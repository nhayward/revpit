##### Bio

Felice is a book editor, ghostwriter, author coach, sensitivity reader, agented author and literary agent. She holds a bachelor's degree in English, concentration Creative Writing, from Georgia State University and a master's degree in Publishing from Kingston University in London, England. There, she specialized in Diversity, Equality and Inclusion in Publishing, which comes in handy when she's working on diversity-centric projects and book ideas. 

As a book editor, she's worked with equal part fiction and nonfiction authors across the gamut of genres. She loves diving in and getting her hands dirty with a manuscript, and she's known for being deeply involved in helping her authors reach their highest potential by offering "mini MFA programs" through her author coaching. She's edited phenomenal books such as Zerlina Maxwell's _The End of White Politics_ (Hachette), Paola Ramos' _Finding Latinx: In Search of the Voices Redefining Latino Identity_ (Vintage) Alexandra Overy's _These Feathered Flames_ (Inkyard Press) and Monica Byrne's _The Actual Star_ (Harper Voyager) among so many others. 

When she's not editing, reading or writing, she loves touring wineries and is addicted to home décor and HGTV.

##### MSWL

I’m looking for adult contemporary literary, upmarket, commercial fiction. I love Southern Gothic fiction, and any fiction that focuses on the beauty of its prose while offering social commentary. I’m typically not a great fit for historical fiction (anything set 50+ years in the past) but I love books that are firmly rooted in modern or futuristic living. I’m looking for a fresh perspective and writing that says “NO!” to clichés and formulaic tropes. You can wow me with writing that offers an energetic voice and a deep sense of place.

WISH LIST:

I have a soft spot for brainy novels set on college campuses like _The Secret History_ by Donna Tartt, _The Dreamers_ by Karen Thompson Walker and _Loner_ by Teddy Wayne; clever ‘whodunits’ set on estates like _The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle_ by Stuart Turton and the 2019 film _Knives Out_; highbrow fiction written around characters of color such as _The Emperor of Ocean Park_ by Stephen L. Carter and _A Little Life_ by Hanya Yanagihara; contemporary Southern Gothic fiction such as Catherine Lacey’s _Pew_; novels featuring multicultural Millennials in high-powered workplace situations; and witty and satirical upmarket women’s fiction that reveals a nasty side to a major industry (i.e. fashion, film, etc.) as in _The Devil Wears Prada_ by Lauren Weisberger. I am intrigued by novels that can introduce readers to a new world, make us think differently about one we already know, or tap into the cultural climate. I’m very interested in finding and uplifting writers from marginalized communities - particularly writers of color. A book that offers sharp social commentary interwoven brilliantly throughout the narrative will keep me up all night reading.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

A resonating first sentence is the key to my editorial heart. Combine that with an immediate sense of urgency in the writing that pulls me in and gorgeous prose, and I’m sold on the first five pages..

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

As an editor, I want to ensure that I’m editing to amplify my writers’ voices (not changing their voices), and I push my authors to be the very best writers that they can be. With me, you don’t just get a pen-to-paper edit; you get overall feedback on how to make your manuscript stand out to industry professionals and on the shelves as well. My communication style is easygoing; I answer emails quickly, and I prefer a casual email communication style with my clients.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Give your manuscript your very best effort, and don’t try to be live everyone else! What do you have to say that no one else can say like you can? The manuscript you’ve always envisioned is already inside of you. Our partnership will help to bring it out! Feel free to reach out to me via email, and be yourself! :)

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Reading, of course! But also I love immersing myself in home décor, traveling to new locales, getting dressed up to go out on the town, shopping and hanging out with my wonderful friends. This year, I also hope to learn to sew and make fresh pasta from scratch!
