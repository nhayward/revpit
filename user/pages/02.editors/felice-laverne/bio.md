##### Bio

Felice is a book editor, ghostwriter, author coach, sensitivity reader, agented author and literary agent. She holds a bachelor's degree in English, concentration Creative Writing, from Georgia State University and a master's degree in Publishing from Kingston University in London, England. There, she specialized in Diversity, Equality and Inclusion in Publishing, which comes in handy when she's working on diversity-centric projects and book ideas. 

As a book editor, she's worked with equal part fiction and nonfiction authors across the gamut of genres. She loves diving in and getting her hands dirty with a manuscript, and she's known for being deeply involved in helping her authors reach their highest potential by offering "mini MFA programs" through her author coaching. She's edited phenomenal books such as Zerlina Maxwell's _The End of White Politics_ (Hachette), Paola Ramos' _Finding Latinx: In Search of the Voices Redefining Latino Identity_ (Vintage) Alexandra Overy's _These Feathered Flames_ (Inkyard Press) and Monica Byrne's _The Actual Star_ (Harper Voyager) among so many others. 

When she's not editing, reading or writing, she loves touring wineries and is addicted to home d√©cor and HGTV.
