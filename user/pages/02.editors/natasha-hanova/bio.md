##### Bio

I’m an experienced developmental editor, with an eye for detail, who has actively participated in multiple critique groups for more than twenty years. I love discussing the craft with others, regardless of where writers are on their journey. It brings me a particular joy to help people source out the cause of writer’s block or plot issues or characters that stop talking. I’m an author coach with The Creatives Apprentice, where we simplify business so writers have the brain space to create, as well.

My experiences as a biracial Black woman fuel not only my storytelling, but my endeavors to lift and support other marginalized writers. As a military kid, I’ve called places as far as Germany home. I now live in the Midwest with my amazing husband, twin boys, daughter, dog, and a sassy cat.

I write Adult/YA contemporary fantasy, romance and dystopian. When I’m not editing, writing or reading, I enjoy time with my family and pets, spending time in nature, crocheting and recently, amigurumi.

My love of crochet has shown me similarities between yarn art and writing: it takes dedication, determination, and resilience to get through to The End. Similarly, my journey in the query trenches is one of persistence and perseverance. I’m now represented by Amy Giuffrida.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Whenever a writer is able to introduce an interesting character with a unique voice, clear goal, and obstacles within the opening pages, it helps the manuscript stand out. The MC’s attitude about the challenges they face and the personality revealed by those obstacles make for relatable characters.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

As a content editor, my number one job is to find what isn’t working for the manuscript, as well as what makes the work shine. You can expect kind, yet honest feedback on plot, pacing, characterization, and worldbuilding. We’ll start with an email, phone call, or Skype/Google Hangout to discuss any concerns. I’ll stay in touch while I do a big-picture content edit. After time to digest feedback, we’ll chat again to go over questions, concerns, or any brainstorming before you attack revisions.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Writing is easy. Writing well is hard. I expect you to be open to feedback and ready to work hard. I love brainstorming and there may be times when we’ll need to work together to find solutions. Communication is key and given the tight timeline, quick responses will help us get the most out of this process.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I like to explore the woods with my family and dog, find a quiet places to read, or crochet while bingeing a variety of shows from _Schitt’s Creek_ to _Derry Girls_ to _Only Murders In The Building_. I also love playing card games and collecting decks of cards. I probably have too many.
