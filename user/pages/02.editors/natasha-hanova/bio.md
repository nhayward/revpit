##### Bio

Natasha Hanova loves imaginative problem solving and discussing the craft of writing with others. She writes sweet and evocative romance with a dark twist and is represented by Veronica Park of Fuse Literary. Natasha’s experiences as a biracial woman fuel not only her storytelling, but her endeavors to lift and support other marginalized writers. 

Natasha is a thorough and understanding freelance developmental editor. Her editorial style has been called a mini workshop. She believes it’s important for writers to come through the editing process with goals they can accomplish. She works on fiction manuscripts from young adult to adult across a variety of genres. When she’s not editing, she’s sipping tea with a good book, watching scary movies while crocheting, or playing cards with her friends.

I love character-driven stories, great voice, and unexpected premises in Adult, New Adult, or Young Adult. I’m drawn in by creative worlds, unique premises, and characters facing impossible choices.

I want…

* Romance, all subgenres (except historical or royal fantasy) and heat levels.
* Paranormal, especially paranormal romance.
* Urban fantasy, dark fantasy, and dystopian.
* New twist on vampires, demons, shifters, witches, etc…YES, please.

I’m **not** the right editor for…
* Any kind of historic fiction.
* Picture books or non-fiction.
* Anything over 110k words.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Whenever a writer is able to introduce an interesting character with a unique voice, clear goal, and obstacles within the opening pages, it helps the manuscript stand out. The MC’s attitude about the challenges they face and the personality revealed by those obstacles make for relatable characters.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

As a content editor, my number one job is to find what isn’t working for the manuscript, as well as what makes the work shine. You can expect kind, yet honest feedback on plot, pacing, characterization, and worldbuilding. We’ll start with an email, phone call, or Skype/Google Hangout to discuss any concerns. I’ll stay in touch while I do a big-picture content edit. After time to digest feedback, we’ll chat again to go over questions, concerns, or any brainstorming before you attack revisions. Then, we’ll repeat the process one final time.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Writing is easy. Writing well is hard. I expect you to be open to feedback and ready to work hard. I love brainstorming and there may be times when we’ll need to work together to find solutions. Communication is key and given the tight timeline, quick responses will help us get the most out of this process.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

When I’m not editing or writing, I’m most likely exploring the woods with my family and dog, trying to find a quiet place to read, or crocheting while bingeing a variety of shows from _Schitt’s Creek_ to _Derry Girls_ to _Black_ (where Ha-ram sees grim reapers). My acrylic on canvas is more about time with friends and family than skill. My Insta is mostly cats.
