##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Whenever a writer is able to introduce an interesting character with a unique voice, clear goal, and obstacles within the opening pages, it helps the manuscript stand out. The MC’s attitude about the challenges they face and the personality revealed by those obstacles make for relatable characters.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

As a content editor, my number one job is to find what isn’t working for the manuscript, as well as what makes the work shine. You can expect kind, yet honest feedback on plot, pacing, characterization, and worldbuilding. We’ll start with an email, phone call, or Skype/Google Hangout to discuss any concerns. I’ll stay in touch while I do a big-picture content edit. After time to digest feedback, we’ll chat again to go over questions, concerns, or any brainstorming before you attack revisions. Then, we’ll repeat the process one final time.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Writing is easy. Writing well is hard. I expect you to be open to feedback and ready to work hard. I love brainstorming and there may be times when we’ll need to work together to find solutions. Communication is key and given the tight timeline, quick responses will help us get the most out of this process. 
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

When I’m not editing or writing, I’m most likely trying to find a quiet place to read. I enjoy going to the movies, bingeing shows like _Parks & Rec_, _The Witcher_, _The Good Place_, or _Supernatural_, and traveling through all of time and space with The Doctor. My acrylic on canvas is more about time with friends and family than skill. My Insta is mostly cats.

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

Oooh…a twist on a common question. To be honest, I don’t usually re-read anything because my shelf is overflowing with all the books I want to read. But if I were going to re-read one, it’d probably be _The Belles_ by Dhonielle Clayton (YA book) for the rich imagination, stunning settings, and unique characters. Or anything by Kresley Cole (either her YA or Adult books) for her fun characters, sassy heroines, and creative worlds.
