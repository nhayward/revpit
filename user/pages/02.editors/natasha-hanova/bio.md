##### Bio

Natasha Hanova, a freelance developmental editor, author, craft coach and RevPit Board member, loves imaginative problem solving and discussing the writing craft. She’s represented by Amy Giuffrida. Natasha specializes in romance, fantasy and SciFi. She applies decades of experience to help creatives hone their craft. Her love of crochet has shown her similarities between yarn art and writing: it takes dedication, determination, and resilience to get through to The End. Natasha believes it’s important for writers to come through the editing process with goals they can accomplish.

##### MSWL

I love character-driven stories, great voice, and unexpected premises in Adult or Young Adult. I’m drawn in by creative worlds, unique premises, and characters facing impossible choices.

I want…
* I’d love to see more diverse fiction!
* Romance, all subgenres, especially RomCom.
* Science fiction.
* Urban fantasy, dark fantasy, and dystopian.
* Horror – Monsters, witchcraft or comedic (ex. _Shaun of the Dead_, _Ready or Not_, or _What We Do In Shadows_).

I’m not the right editor for…
* Historic fiction.
* Picture books, middle grade, or non-fiction.
* Horror subgenres slasher, religious horror, gore/splatter, or psychological.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

It helps the manuscript stand out whenever a writer is able to introduce an interesting character with a unique voice, clear goal, and obstacles within the opening pages. The MC’s attitude about the challenges they face and the personality revealed by those obstacles make for relatable characters.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

My number one job is to find what isn’t working for the manuscript, as well as what makes the work shine. You can expect kind, yet honest feedback on plot, pacing, characterization, and worldbuilding. We’ll start with an email, phone call, or Zoom/Google Meet to discuss any concerns. I’ll stay in touch while I do a big-picture developmental edit. After time to digest the edit letter and feedback, we’ll chat again to go over questions, concerns, or any brainstorming before you attack revisions. If time permits, I’ll do a second read.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Writing is easy. Writing well is hard. I expect writers to be open to feedback and ready to work hard. I love brainstorming and there may be times when we’ll need to work together to find solutions. Communication is key and given the tight timeline, quick responses will help us get the most out of this process.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I have entered my puzzle era. I love time with my family, exploring the outdoors with my dog or snuggling up with a book and my cat, whenever she deigns to join me. I also enjoy crocheting, word games, card games and board games like Codenames, Catan or The Chameleon (alliteration unintended).
