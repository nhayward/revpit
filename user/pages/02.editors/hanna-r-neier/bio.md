##### Bio

Hanna R. Neier is a novelist, lifestyle writer and freelance editor. She loves helping writers bring their characters to life and their words to the page. Interested in a wide range of fiction at the adult and middle grade level, Hanna has a soft spot for historical narratives and stories centered around family dynamics. If a book makes her both laugh and cry, it will likely win her over.

When not lost in a book (her own or somebody else’s), Hanna can be found cooking, baking, gardening, exploring the city, and spending time with her family and friends. Her essays, interviews and lifestyle articles have appeared in POPSUGAR, Lilith Magazine, Kveller and Motherly, among other publications, and she is the 2025 winner of the Sydney Taylor Manuscript Award. She holds a bachelor's degree in history from McGill University, a law degree from Brooklyn Law School and practiced law for six years (please don’t hold that against her) before making the transition to writing when her first daughter was born.

Hanna currently lives in Brooklyn, NY with her husband, two kids and far too many houseplants. She is represented by Laura Crockett at Triada US Literary Agency.

##### MSWL

I read broadly and would probably fall in love with any well-told story, but feel I’d be the most helpful for those looking to workshop adult historical fiction, women’s and book club fiction, middle grade historical and middle grade contemporary. While I’m not looking for sci-fi or high fantasy in any age range, I do also tend to fall in love with stories grounded in the real world but with a touch of magic (e.g. time travel, curses, etc). 

**Please send me books that have…**
* Compelling family dynamics, especially sibling relationships
* Unreliable narrators
* Atmospheric writing
* Books with a strong emotional core
* Diversity and representation of all kinds of people—race, religion, ethnicity, ability, neurodiversity, socioeconomics, military status, LGBTQIA+ etc.

(This is just a starting list, if you think I’m the right fit, please send me your book!)

**Please do NOT send me …**
* Horror
* Child abuse on the page
* Overly preachy books (politically, morally or otherwise)

**Some favorite books…**
* _The People We Keep_ (Allison Larkin) (adult near-historical)
* _The Nightingale_ (Kristin Hannah) (adult historical fiction)
* _The Midnight Library_ (Matt Haig) (adult contemporary w/speculative element)
* _The Ghost of Hannah Mendes_ (Naomi Ragen) (adult dual-timeline w/touch of magic)
* _When You Reach Me_ (Rebecca Stead) (MG historical fiction with touch of magic)
* _Echo_ (Pam Muñoz Ryan) (MG historical with touch of magic)
* _Letters from Cuba_ (Ruth Behar) (MG historical fiction)
* _Aftermath_ (Emily Barth Isler) (MG contemporary fiction)

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

Bring me right into your world! Put me in your character's mind, let me feel and see through them. Give me atmosphere, use all five senses, but most importantly give me emotion. Make me care for your character and be curious about what is happening now and what the future holds.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

You have already taken the very difficult step of seeking out editorial help, so congratulations! It's a scary feeling, that turning over of your book baby to another person, hoping that they love it and see it's potential the same way you do. As a writer, I understand that on a deep, visceral level. And I promise to handle with care, while still giving you honest feedback to help make your book the best version of itself. 

This will be a collaborative process-- I will be navigating, creating an edit roadmap, but you'll be in the driver's seat. We'll start with a conversation (email or Zoom, whichever you prefer) in which we'll discuss where you are in your writing journey and what your challenges have been so far. Then I'll go into editing mode! When I'm done, you'll receive a detailed Edit Letter from me going over both the manuscript's strengths and the areas in which I see room for improvement. Along with the letter, you'll received a Tracked Changes version of your book with on-the-page examples of my feedback. In a developmental edit, I tend to focus on big picture issues like pacing, structure, character development and the way in which you use language but I tailor my attention and my feedback to suit each writer's needs. Once you've had a chance to digest everything (and you should totally take time to digest it all!), we will schedule a Zoom call where we can go over an edit plan and answer any questions. 

I am available for guidance via email and usually answer in a day or two. I am here to help and can't wait to dive in!

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

All I ask is that you  be open and honest with me and use this opportunity to its full potential. We are in this together, but ultimately this is your work and your vision that we are trying to bring to life. I am here to empower you, as a writer. I can provide the roadmap, but only you can drive the car home. (Sorry, did I belabor that metaphor? Can't help it!)

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Although I live in NYC, I'm a big fan of nature, so you'll often find me wandering city park trails, weeding my tiny urban garden, or taking pictures of particularly gorgeous trees. A lifelong baker, I discovered the joys of sourdough bread with everyone else in 2020, so I'm always looking for new ways to use that leftover starter. I love coffee with friends, hanging out with my family, watching funny TV and, of course, a good book.
