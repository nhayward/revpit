##### Bio

Maria is one half Tolkien, one half Captain Kirk. She began writing fan fiction in high school and hasn't looked back since; not even when university forced her to write fancier shmancier things. Though she double majored in English Literature and Philosophy, Maria discovered a love for editing. She is also a YA and Adult writer, Blogger, Tweeter, and Writetuber. With twelve years freelance developmental editing under her belt, and a strange penchant for query writing, she strives to break down the doors, change conversations, and polish manuscripts until they shine. 

##### MSWL

**I’m changing things up a bit for 2020, and narrowing my MSWL to the following genres:  **

 1. Historical Fiction (including gothic—ghosties, ghouls, paranormal—alternate history/fantasy, steampunk, etc). Word to the wise…I’m a history aficionado, and if I’m unfamiliar with a certain era, I will research to ensure accuracy. My favorite historical periods include the Viking Age, the Restoration Period, and the late 1700’s. I would like to see untold/rarely told stories (no Anne Boleyn, Marie Antoinette, etc.), and any manuscript that throws a spotlight on underrepresented groups of any era. 
 2. Fantasy, but limited to contemporary (preferably dark), urban, and second-world low fantasy (including elements of paranormal, supernatural. Give me witches. Worldbuilding. Tough heroines and questionable morals. 
 3. Horror. But let me be clear—no slasher/gore bonanzas. I’m not looking for shock value. I want hair-raising, sleep with the light on feels that leave me in a state of panic (I’m the toughest person to scare, so anyone who can do this is my new idol.  
 4. \#ownvoices (As an immigrant, this is very dear to my heart) 
 5. Ace representation

**Things I love: **

 * New twists on tired tropes—friends to lovers, love triangles, chosen ones, etc. Make it fresh…polyamory? Chosen ones who turn into the antagonist? Whatever it is, it needs to jump off the page and make me sit up straight 
 * Vampires and werewolves! GIVE THEM TO ME! 
 * Pre-Regency historical, any country 
 * Most fantasy sub-genres 
 * Light sci-fi

**Preferred Markets:** 

 * Upper MG  
 * YA 
 * Adult 
 
**Do Not Send:**

 * Books depicting slave trade (African or European) 
 * Erotica 
 * Royals (In fantasy…if there are royals in your historical, that’s acceptable), or Mermaids 
 * Sparkly vampires or wizards 
 * Gore/Slashers 
 * Contemporary 
 * High Fantasy 
 * Adult Sci-fi 
 * Romance that’s actually erotica 
 * Rape…masquerading as romance 
 * Abuse…masquerading as romance 
 * Redemption arcs for abusers 
 * Historical Fiction set in my lifetime, or a decade before, because…that makes me feel some sort of way. Nothing from the 1970’s, 80’s, or 90’s.  

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

First and foremost, the voice of the main character. When the narrative voice meshes with the voice of a character, magic happens. Secondly, beginning in a scene that sets up the main character’s CURRENT stakes so that I’m invested from the first paragraph. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writers can expect honesty. If something’s not working, I will tell you. I’m good for bouncing ideas, and will offer craft help when appropriate. Communication-wise, you can expect a full edit letter and an appointment to discuss the work required of the writer to get that manuscript shining for the showcase. I will also make myself available for support when my schedule allows.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect writers to be open to feedback, and willing to make the necessary changes. As far as communication goes, I expect writers to reach out when in need of support, and to let me know if life gets in the way so we can modify our editing plan together.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Reading! Ha! Other than that, no real hobbies. But I try to be a kick-ass mom to my kid. 

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

_The Other Boleyn Girl_ by Philippa Gregory. There’s something about Mary’s authenticity and voice that immerses the reader in the cesspool that was Henry VIII’s court. It gripped me the first time I read it (at age 15). I’ve reread it every year since, and it stands the test of time as a great study in historical voice that appeals to a commercial market, deep POV, characterization, and heart-pounding suspense. The movie didn’t do the book justice (CW for the movie: They added a rape scene that didn’t exist in Gregory’s work). 10/10 would recommend the book!
