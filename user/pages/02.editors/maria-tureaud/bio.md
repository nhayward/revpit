##### Bio

Maria is one half Tolkien, one half Captain Kirk. She began writing fan fiction in high school and hasn't looked back since &mdash;not even when university forced her to write fancier shmancier things. Though she double-majored in English Literature and Philosophy, Maria discovered a passion for editing. But Maria is also a writer, and writes in multiple genres for both the YA and Adult markets, which means she’s familiar with both giving and receiving critique and feedback. Maria also blogs about writing craft, tweets, is an active writetuber, and is one of the founding members of CraftQuest. With twelve years freelance, developmental editing under her belt, and a sometimes-masochistic love for query writing, she strives to break down the doors, change conversations, and help writers achieve their best &mdash;one word at a time.

##### MSWL

**Preferred markets:** Upper Middle Grade, Young Adult, New Adult, and Adult.

**Preferred genres:** Historical, Horror, Fantasy, Paranormal, Romance, Sci-fi, Thriller.

Maria likes her heroes tough, and her heroines tougher with a character arc to die for. Her MSWL includes:

 * New twists on tired tropes – friends to lovers, love triangles, chosen ones, heroine saves hero, etc.
 * New twists on vampires and werewolves
 * Anything Paranormal
 * Historical Fiction – preferably pre-Regency starring real people we don’t normally see in historical fiction.
 * Most fantasy sub-genres
 * Light sci-fi
 * Romance with a twist!
 * **HORROR** – ALL THE HORROR

**She Is Not The Best Candidate For:**

 * Erotica
 * Contemporary
 * High Fantasy
 * Adult Sci-fi
 * Sparkly or regular old vampires
 * Poorly/minimally researched historical fiction—she will research the details to ensure accuracy and is an expert in both the Reformation and Restoration eras
 * Romance that’s actually erotica
 * Rape…masquerading as romance
 * Abuse…masquerading as romance
 * Redemption arcs for abusers
 * MG Romance…weird
 * Historical Fiction set in her lifetime, or a decade before, because…that makes her feel some sort of way. Nothing from the 1970’s, 80’s, or 90’s.


##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

First and foremost, the voice of the main character. When the narrative voice meshes with the voice of a character, magic happens. Secondly, beginning in a scene that sets up the main character’s CURRENT stakes so that I’m invested from the first paragraph.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writers can expect honesty. If something’s not working, I will tell you. I’m good for bouncing ideas, and will offer craft help when appropriate. Communication-wise, you can expect a full edit letter and an appointment to discuss the work required of the writer to get that manuscript shining for the showcase. I will also make myself available for support when my schedule allows.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect writers to be open to feedback, and willing to make the necessary changes. As far as communication goes, I expect writers to reach out when in need of support, and to let me know if life gets in the way so we can modify our editing plan together.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Reading! Ha! Other than that, no real hobbies. But I try to be a kick-ass mom to my kid.

**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

I mean…can we even have this conversation and not talk about _The Cruel Prince_ by Holly Black? What a luscious book! And what did I love? THAT ENDING! The way the twist took us by complete surprise. It changed the way I approach big reveals &mdash;in my own work, and the work of my clients.
