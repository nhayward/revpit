##### Bio

Maria Tureaud hails from the Wild Atlantic Way on the west coast of Ireland. A Developmental Editor of fourteen years, Maria serves on the Revise & Resub (#RevPit on Twitter) Board, and works with NYC publishing house Macmillan. When she’s not writing books, or sprinkling magic into client manuscripts, you can find her drinking tea in New Jersey with her husband and son, as she dreams of moving home to her beloved County Clare.

**Pronouns: She/Her**

##### MSWL

I’m changing things up a bit for 2024, and narrowing my MSWL to the following genres: 
1. Romantasy of all flavors.
2. Fantasy, especially from #ownvoices cultures and folklore we don’t traditionally see in publishing. Give me worldbuilding, tough heroines/heroes, and questionable morals.
3. Horror. But no slasher/gore bonanzas. I’m not looking for shock value. I want hair-raising, sleep with the light on feels that leave me in a state of panic (I’m the toughest person to scare, so anyone who can do this is a God/dess. 
4. Historical Fiction, but I’d prefer #ownvoices works from places and people we don’t traditionally see in publishing. The exception would be anything from the Stuart reign.

**Things I love:**
* New twists on tired tropes—friends to lovers, love triangles, chosen ones, etc
* Most fantasy sub-genres
* Light sci-fi
* Romance with a twist…as in, the romance—not the plot—has a twist.
* HORROR – ALL THE HORROR (If you can scare me, I’ll throw in a free Query Critique. Yes. I’m that confident).

**Preferred Markets:**
* Upper MG 
* YA
* NA
* Adult

**I Am Not The Best Advocate For:**
* Erotica
* Contemporary
* High Fantasy
* Adult Sci-fi
* Romance that’s actually erotica
* Rape…masquerading as romance
* Abuse…masquerading as romance
* Redemption arcs for abusers
* Adult Historical Fiction set in my lifetime, or a decade before, because…that makes me feel some sort of way. Nothing from the 1970’s, 80’s, or 90’s.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

A setting grounded in place, time, and a character's emotional wound generally draws me in. Couple that with a great premise, and I'm hooked.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writers can expect efficiency, collaboration, and--hehe--I have a tendency to over-communicate a little. I like authors to know where I am in the process, and when to expect material/what is expected at every juncture.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

As RevPit is not a mentorship, but an opportunity to receive a professional Developmental Edit, I expect openness, and willingness to collaborate, as that's the only way a Developmental Edit can be executed. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I'm a K-drama enthusiast, so if you're Team "I watched Goblin for the bromance," I think we'll really get along!
