##### Bio

Ellen is a professional freelance editor with seven years of experience. She started editing full time in 2011 and began working shortly after as an editor with Musa Publishing where she was quickly promoted to head editor of Musa’s middle grade imprint. She left Musa in 2012 to freelance full time. Since then she has worked with about 150 writers per year as an editor, writing coach, and plot consultant.

Ellen's clients are represented at a number of agencies, including The Unter Agency, Irene Goodman Literary Agency, and Upstart Crow Literary. Her clients have published with Katherine Tegen Books, The Wild Rose Press, and many have launched successful self-publishing careers. Ellen has a bachelor’s degree in communications with a focus on writing from the University of Cincinnati.

When she's not editing (which isn’t often!) Ellen enjoys cooking and tasting recipes from around the world, trying her hand at a variety of craft projects, and spending time with her husband and three-year-old poodle Toby.
