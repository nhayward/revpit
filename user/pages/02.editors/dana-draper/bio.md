##### Bio

Dana Draper is an author, editor, and high school English teacher living in the Chicagoland suburbs. She has loved stories since she was old enough to read, and stories with any amount of magic hold a special place in her heart. Specifically, she values fantastical stories featuring queer and Asian representation that also explores the complexities of mental health. All of her fiction work is represented by Root Literary Agency, and Upper YA/A Fantasy is her preferred genre to write. 

In 2023, she graduated with her MA in English and Creative Writing, and through her graduate coursework, she discovered her love for working with other authors as a developmental editor. She’s a member of the EFA and has worked as a freelance editor at Query Buddy Editorial for over three years, and she hopes to pursue that, along with writing, full-time one day. In her spare time, you’ll find Dana cozied up in her home office writing or curled up on the couch rewatching _Bridgerton_ or _Game of Thrones_.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

As a long-time escapist reader, I want to be swallowed by your world immediately. I don’t mean you should info-dump the entire exposition on the first five pages; I want to be immersed in whatever situation, setting, or predicament your character faces right away. If you can make me feel like I am part of the story immediately, rather than outside looking in, it’ll be very hard for me to not want more. Whatever the POV or genre, all I want is to feel like I am immediately ‘in’ it (and that the 'it' is relevant and relatable).

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

My mindset as an editor is flexible; I aim to focus on one or two major concepts (narrative structure, POV, voice, conflict, etc.) my author wants the most attention on as they prepare to revise. Teamwork and goal-setting right away is key. With that said, my personal natural tendency is to focus on character development and overall plot sense as I read for a developmental edit. You can expect a collaborative attitude, a tough(ish)-love approach, and a willingness to explore multiple avenues for revision. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

As an experienced teacher, editor, and author, I have become a pro at the ‘sandwich’ method, meaning you can expect me to find a shining moment or skill within your writing for every critique or need for improvement that I identify. I also aim to highlight any culturally sensitive content/topics within the story that may need extra care and thoughtfulness. As a #RevPit editor, I’ll work with you to set goals that feel actionable and comfortable for us both. I work best with written communication (poor memory issues) but am open to an initial Zoom meeting once the edit letter has been sent! If any questions or ideas arise as you are revising, I will also be available via email to discuss as needed. The end of our work together will include a final reread of the revised manuscript (with emphasis on the new changes) and an editorial discussion of the query package.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Beyond writing and editing, I love binging shows or playing video games. Recently, we watched (and LOVED) the shows _Shrinking_, _Silo_, and _Love is Blind UK_. Obviously, my taste in television is sort of scattered across the board, but my husband and I love anything that we can connect with and talk about. My favorite games include _Fortnite_ (yes, I know - it is a guilty pleasure), _Skyrim_, and _Diablo IV_. You can also find me frequently snuggling my Border Collie, Juney, and enjoying very long walks in the nature preserve across the street.
