##### Bio

Sione Aeschliman (pronounced see-OWN ASH-lemon) is an editor and writing coach with a Master’s degree in English and over fifteen years of editing experience who gets massive amounts of satisfaction from helping authors achieve their writing and publishing goals. Despite having lived in Portland, Oregon off and on since 1998, she does not own a bicycle and is woefully under-prepared for the zombie apocalypse. She does, however, live with an adorkable dog named Milton who’s an Expert Urban Forager. This is Sione's second year as a Revise & Resub (RevPit) editor, and she can't wait to connect with existing writer friends, make new ones, read the 2018 submissions, and get to work on another amazing book! 

##### MSWL

This year I'm accepting submissions for YA, NA, and A novels in any genre. I'm passionate about character-driven narratives that explore important questions about human experiences in ways that are fresh, accessible, deeply connecting, and entertaining. I'm particularly (though not exclusively) interested in #ownvoices novels from underrepresented perspectives, including (but again not exclusively) non-White, non-Western, intersex, transgender, NB, asexual, aromantic, demisexual, pansexual, and/or polyamorous perspectives.

I have broad tastes in literature, and the books I've chosen to work on for contests in the past two years reflect this: contemporary romance, science fantasy, biopunk scifi, Buddhist sci-fan, magic realism, and paranormal romance.

That said, I'm not the best fit for:
 * Gory horror (though non-gory horror would be awesome!)
 * Shifters, vampires, zombies (unless it's **literary** speculative fiction, in which case bring it on!)
 * BDSM
 * Eroticized non-consensual sex (none of this, please)

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

There are lots of great ways to hook me, but I've noticed I'm more likely to be hooked if the first five pages are rooted in a scene with a goal and stakes; convey a strong sense of voice, emotion, and setting; and include the first inciting incident related to the primary conflict (or I can see it's coming soon).

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

The author I choose to work with can expect that I will work my butt off for them, partner with them to help them achieve their vision for the book in a way that meets readers' expectations, communicate clearly and in a timely manner about the editing process, and meet my deadlines. My goal is to get through two rounds of editing on the full ms, plus a polish of the first five pages and the query letter in preparation for the showcase. Based on past years, I anticipate putting in 40-50 hours of editing over the 5 weeks. My author and I will decide together how we will approach the editing process and how we want to communicate, but I normally start with a high-level critique of the full ms and use a mixture of email, Word documents, and voice or video chats.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

In order to make the most of our 5 weeks together, my author will need to be to be ready to dive back into editing the big-picture elements of their manuscript, be willing put at least as much time and energy into their work as I do, communicate clearly and in a timely manner about their expectations and their process, ask questions when my suggestions don’t resonate, and meet the deadlines we agree on.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Reading the heck out of books (of course), going to surf-punk and post-punk shows at dive bars and eating delicious foods (Italian, Mexican, Thai, & sushi among my faves) with my peeps, taking walks with Milton, hosting game nights (think Settlers of Catan, Elder Sign, and _Lord of the Rings_ Trivial Pursuit), binge-watching TV shows (e.g. _Black Mirror, Blindspot, The Blacklist_), traveling with my awesome mom.

**What was your favorite childhood book and what did you love about it?**

Ermahgerd. As if I could pick just one! I'm gonna cheat and say the entire Wizard of Oz series by Frank L. Baum. One summer when I was probably 8 or 9, I devoured two to three books per week until I'd read all the Oz books my library carried. I loved the world-building - all those fantastical people and cultures Dorothy encountered on her adventures.
