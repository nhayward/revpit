##### Bio

Sione Aeschliman (pronounced see-OWN ASH-lemon) is an editor and writing coach with a Master's degree in English and over fourteen years of editing experience. Despite living in Portland, Oregon, she does not own a bicycle and is woefully underprepared for the zombie apocalypse. She does, however, live with an adorkable dog named Milton who's an Expert Urban Forager. She can't wait to read the submissions, reconnect with members of the Twitter writing community, and meet new writer-friends.
