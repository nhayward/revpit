##### Bio

Megan Records has been a professional editor for over 13 years. She edits most types of fiction, but particularly loves romance, mysteries, and YA. Editing isn’t just about fixing—it’s about learning what you’re doing right, where you can improve, and how you can grow as a writer. Through developmental and line editing, Megan helps authors make their stories shine!

After getting her M.S. in Publishing, she spent a year in educational publishing before finding her dream job at Kensington Publishing, where she edited for the Brava, Zebra, and KTeen lines. She’s worked with authors at the top of their careers, including NYT and USA Today bestselling authors, and ones just starting out. Now as a freelancer, she collaborates with publishers (such as Sourcebooks and Grand Central) and authors to make awesome stories.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

A strong voice will drag me in from the start. Other than that, I really like when I can start to see the potential conflict with your inciting incident. Does your heroine show up to her cabin in the middle of a snowstorm to find out the cabin is already occupied? Hooray! Did a king/duke/leader just die in your historical/fantasy/paranormal, and now there are questions about the heir? I’m all over it. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I always say a good editor is a coach, not a critic. I’ll cheer you on when you’re doing something right, point out what’s not working, and give you specific suggestions for improving.  Expect to start with big picture issues so we can make sure all the elements are in place. I’d like to do an initial phone/Skype call so we can get to know each other a bit, and then I’ll stick to email after that. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

The editing process should be collaborative. I don’t want you to blindly accept every suggestion I make, but I do need you to be open to change and willing to work with me. You need to ask questions, want to solve problems, and hopefully learn a bit!
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I like to sew, bake, mentally redecorate/renovate my house, and play board games with my husband and kids. Recent TV watches include _Schitt’s Creek_ and _Crash Landing on You_. And obviously I read a lot. 

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

I’ve read the Harry Potter series more times than I remember (proud Ravenclaw here). It’s not a particularly creative or unique answer, but I’m owning it. (My love for the story and character hasn't changed, but I don't support JK due to her anti-trans actions and speech. I'm fully open to trans authors and welcome suggestions on how best to support them.)
