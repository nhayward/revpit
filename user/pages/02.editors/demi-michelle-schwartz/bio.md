##### MSWL

"I’m so excited to share my #RevPit manuscript wish list. I can’t wait to read your work this spring.

First, these are the age categories and genres I’m most eager to see.

* MG - Mystery, Fantasy, Horror
* YA - Thriller, Mystery, Fantasy, Horror
* Adult - Thriller, Mystery

Below, you’ll find some of my specific interests in these genres. Still, if your manuscript falls into the list above, please do submit to me. Sometimes, I don’t know how perfect a book is for me until I read it.

**Mystery and Thriller** - I enjoy twisty plots and complex character dynamics. Especially in this space, it’s interesting how characters interact with one another and reveal darker sides of psychology and why people do the things they do. Some specifics I love are locked-room settings, games and puzzles, speculative twists, unreliable narrators, psychological thrillers, and intricate character relationships.

**Fantasy** - There’s something so magical about escaping into a fantastical story that draws on the imagination and takes me on an adventure. I prefer contemporary fantasy grounded in reality, rather than high fantasy. It’s fascinating when magical elements are intertwined with the real world in fresh ways. Some favorites in fantasy are fairy tale reimaginings, folklore, mythology, especially Greek, Roman, and Egyptian, elemental magic, prophecies, quests and adventures, and original lore and magic systems.

**Horror** - In this space, my interests lean toward the supernatural. Send me your ghost stories, tales with demonic possession, and anything involving evil spirits. I also love psychological horror. No matter what, I want to be scared, so I’m looking for horror stories that are atmospheric, twisty, and packed with emotion.

**Across all genres, I enjoy:**
* Friendship stories, especially when it’s enemies to friends or focused on strong friendships that survive even the most difficult tests.
* Complicated family relationships, especially sisters.
* Settings in nature, like forests, caves, islands, mountains, and the ocean.
* Banter, I love to laugh.
* Sarcastic and sassy female characters who aren’t afraid to be bold or have an attitude.
* Lots of emotion, whether I end up laughing or crying.
* Anything involving music and the arts.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

As an editor, and a reader in general, there are certain elements that grab my attention right away in opening pages. I could go on and on about this, but I want to highlight five of the biggest ones for me.
1. Voice - This is huge. I can tell very fast, sometimes in just the first paragraph, if a manuscript has a strong voice. Since I read a lot of work, I automatically pick up on things that indicate whether or not a story’s voice is developed. So, this is definitely number one for me.
2. Character - As a reader, I need to connect to a character in order to feel compelled to immerse myself into the plot. So, I’m looking for glimpses of characterization, interiority, emotional resonance, and other elements that draw me deep into the protagonist’s point of view.
3. Intrigue - Within the opening pages, I’m looking for a moment that really grabs my attention. An intriguing hook could show up in countless ways, so I don’t want to point out something specific here. In general, this is a part that makes me want to read on to learn more. As the author, your goal is to hook me with your first five pages so strongly that I literally have no choice but to dive into the full.
4. Sensory Details - I always look for sensory details and vivid setting descriptions in opening pages. These details give insight into the world and allow me to immerse myself into your protagonist’s point of view.
5. Genre - I love to see hints of the genre. For example, the opening of a thriller will be different from a fantasy. Meeting reader expectations right away by establishing the genre at the beginning of the story is definitely something that I look for when reading opening pages.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

This one is for my future winner. Hi, future winner!
1. I will be your biggest cheerleader. From the moment I pick you, you’ll be a top priority for me. Even when the contest is over, I will still support you as you chase your publishing dreams.
2. You will receive very detailed feedback on your manuscript from me by May 1. My goal is to get you your edits promptly. That way, you can dive into revisions as soon as possible. When I give you your first round of feedback, I will leave in-line comments and suggestions and write a multi-page edit letter. To give you perspective, my full manuscript critiques typically have around 1,000 in-line comments. I genuinely love what I do and try to be as detailed as possible.
3. In terms of communication, I will respond to all emails quickly, typically within twenty-four hours. It is important to me that you feel supported on this journey, so I will check in with you weekly and respond to any questions you may have as fast as I possibly can.
4. I love calls because this is where magic can happen. So, once you receive your feedback, we will set up a time to chat over Google Meet about your manuscript. During revisions, we can set up additional times to talk if needed.
5. Once you finish your revision, I will read your manuscript again. The second time, I will only write an edit letter, not leave in-line comments. It is important to me that you take the time you need, so if your full manuscript isn’t ready for me to read again by the showcase, you can send it to me whenever it is ready. I’ll be sure to work you into my schedule.
6. For the showcase, I’ll work with you to polish your query and opening pages. I will also go back and forth with you on these as many times as you would like.

If you happen to be my future winner, I can’t wait to work with you. :)

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

If you’re my winner, there are some things I expect from your side.
1. Please respond to my emails! It is important we have strong communication during the whole process to ensure we’re staying on top of things.
2. Deadlines are our friends. Once you have your edits from me, we’ll chat about a revision plan. To keep you on target, we’ll decide on realistic deadlines. It is important that these are met to ensure we stay on track. In other words, no procrastinating to the night before something is supposed to be done. ;) I’ll be able to tell, trust me.
3. Be ready to work, work, work. You’ll have the best #RevPit experience if you give it your all. Getting chosen is huge, so be prepared to make the most of this opportunity. I want my winner to be motivated, excited about revising, and eager to learn.
4. Most of all, I want my lucky winner to have fun. Yes, we’ll both be working, but this is supposed to be a fun experience. I always have a blast while editing. My Amethyst Ink clients will tell you that I leave funny reaction comments in their manuscripts along with the suggestions. I’m ready to have a blast helping you make your story sparkle, so I hope you’ll come into this experience with a positive attitude and ready to have fun along the way.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Hobbies? I feel like everything that was once a hobby has turned into a bigger part of my life. I need to find an actual hobby. Anyway, when I’m not editing, writing, or reading, you can find me immersed in music. As a songwriter, recording artist, and classical pianist, I’m always writing, singing, or playing songs, and you can sometimes see me on red carpets. Music awards are fun! On top of music, I enjoy listening to podcasts when I’m not busy with my own. My favorite is the Newest Olympian, which is a Percy Jackson podcast. If you’re curious, I’m actually a daughter of Apollo. ;)
