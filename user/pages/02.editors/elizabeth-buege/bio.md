##### Bio

Elizabeth Buege is a Midwestern girl with a lifelong love of words. She could write her name when she was two, taught herself to read when she was four, and found by high school that people refused to play word games with her because she always won. After graduating with a B.A. in English writing and internship experience in book editing, she started her own editing business. She picked up some part-time teaching experience along the way, with three years teaching Spanish at a private school and four years teaching secondary writing classes for a local homeschool co-op. Elizabeth loves editing because it combines two of her favorite things: getting lost in books and helping people. When she’s not working, you can find her learning languages, gaming with friends, drinking tea, and making tasty messes in the kitchen.

##### MSWL

As always, my wish list is fairly specific. Please read carefully. I do NOT have a word count limit, but stay within the guidelines for your genre.

**Adult:**

 * Preferred genres: magic realism ([READ THIS FIRST](http://www.elizabethbuege.com/magic-realism-do-you-really-know-what-it-is?target=_blank)), historical fiction, faith-based stories (any genre), fantasy, science fiction, and contemporary. Yes, I like space opera. Yes, other genres are okay if they are character-focused (see below).
* Do NOT send: horror, paranormal as a genre, zombies, demons as main characters, and anything as gross as or grosser than season 3 of Stranger Things. Also, while I love romance in stories, I don’t want straight-up romance as the genre.
* Stories should be character-focused: the main character should have compelling internal and external struggles/journeys and compelling motivations.
* Bonus points: a focus on strong friendships, family bonds (especially siblings), characters dealing with the aftermath of personal loss, and retellings of fairy tales and other classic stories.

**YA:**

 * Preferred genres: magic realism ([READ THIS FIRST](http://www.elizabethbuege.com/magic-realism-do-you-really-know-what-it-is?target=_blank)), historical fiction, and faith-based stories (any genre).
* I will only accept other genres in YA if they meet at least two of my bonus points: a focus on strong friendships, family bonds (especially siblings), characters dealing with the aftermath of personal loss, and retellings of fairy tales and other classic stories. I will NOT take horror, paranormal, or romance (see note under adult).

**MG:**

 * Preferred genres: magic realism ([READ THIS FIRST](http://www.elizabethbuege.com/magic-realism-do-you-really-know-what-it-is?target=_blank)), historical fiction, and faith-based stories (any genre).
* I will only accept other genres in MG if they meet at least two of my bonus points: a focus on strong friendships, family bonds (especially siblings), characters dealing with the aftermath of personal loss, and retellings of fairy tales and other classic stories. I will NOT take horror or paranormal (see note under adult).

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

The biggest factor is the hardest to quantify: it’s the author’s voice. I get really excited when I read a story where the author writes in a way that feels natural, engaging, and well-developed in terms of style, sentence structure, and basic scene pacing. I also feel most drawn into stories where the opening pages give me a good sense of who the main character is and what they want out of life. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

My first pass through your book will involve a full edit letter (the same one I do for critiques) as well as a summary of suggestions for each chapter. After you make revisions, I’ll make another full pass through the manuscript, focusing feedback on whatever your story still needs (this will include annotations to the text). I’ll also block out time near the end of the process for multiple passes through your query letter and opening pages. I’ll be available by email throughout the entire process and always ready to bounce ideas back and forth.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Be ready and able to make major revisions in short windows of time. If I pick your story, it means it’s a good story and that I love it, but that love is going to look like tough love. I’ll be challenging you to deepen characterization and clarify plot elements in situations where there’s not always a “right” way to do so, so you should be ready to think through solutions. The more revisions you make after my first pass, the more constructive the second pass will be. Likewise, the sooner you can get back to me with query/page updates, the more time we’ll have for multiple passes on those materials. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

In no particular order, here are some of my loves: I love photography, state parks, and combining the two. I love making huge messes in the kitchen as I experiment with new recipes, with bonus points if the ingredients came from my friends at the local farmer’s market. I love dancing and singing to my favorite songs when nobody is around. I love games, whether tabletop or video games. My nerdiest obsession remains Minecraft, which has been an insanely abundant fountain of creativity and community for me.
