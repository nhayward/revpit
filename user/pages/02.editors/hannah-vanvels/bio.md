##### Bio

Hannah VanVels is an editor and literary agent at Belcastro Agency. Hannah has worked various bookish jobs including a stint as a bookseller at Barnes & Noble, a freelance editor for scholarly and academic essays and journals, and most recently as the acquiring editor at a young adult imprint with HarperCollins Publishing. 

With nearly a decade of editorial work under her belt, Hannah made the jump to freelance editing. Her editing business was born out of a love for working closely with authors and coming alongside them to make their vision come to life on page. Hannah lives in West Michigan with her partner, two German Shepherds, and two cats.

##### MSWL

This year, I’m only open to Middle Grade, books for readers ages 8-12. 

**Middle Grade**
 * Adventure
	 * I would love to find a MG version of The Mummy (the Brendan Frasier version, of course)
	 * Characters that are on the spectrum, but their story is not centered on that; it's just who they are.
 * Animal protagonists
	 * Animal protagonists are surprisingly polarizing, but I am firmly in the pro camp!
 * Contemporary
	 * Stories of friendship, silly antics, and growing up
	 * Evergreen themes: body positivity, self-love, coming-of-age, girls supporting girls, friendship and friendship breakups
 * Fantasy
	 * Magical schools 
	 * Stories inspired by myths, folklore, or legends
 * Historical
	 * Focusing on BIPOC stories and historically marginalized voices and characters
 * Horror or paranormal
	 * Give me the ghosts, creepy crawlies, and witches  
 * Science fiction
	 * Accessible science fiction. Think Star Wars or superhero movies. I'm looking for a strong grounded story in which you do not need to understand the ins and outs of time travel and quantum physics in order to follow along

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

A killer first line is a must. I also like to have some sense of who the main character is/is going to be, some idea of the main thrust of the plot, and most of all an idea of the stakes. And of course, the ever-elusive VOICE.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writing is an inherently personal art, so I am always aware of what a privilege it is for me as an editor to be entrusted with a writer's story. It is an editor’s job to help make a writer's work shine, so I make sure that I have a clear idea of a writer's editorial vision, and then I come alongside to help bring that vision to life on page. Editing is a collaborative effort, and I’m always available to freak out, brainstorm, and am completely in your corner when it comes to your story.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Revising is hard, and I expect writers to put in the work. I expect writers to be open to criticism, be willing to kill their darlings, and be honest and transparent in their communication with me.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love traveling! However, these days, I mostly travel between my office and the couch. Two of my favorite recent traveling adventures have been riding a camel through the Suq in Petra, Jordan, and feeding stingrays in the Cayman Islands!

**What was your favorite show to binge watch in the last year?**

I am a complete sucker for nearly any show on HGTV. In the past year, my favorite binge was _From Fixer to Fabulous_.
