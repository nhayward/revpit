##### Bio

Hannah VanVels is an editor, writer, and literary agent at Corvisiero Literary Agency.

With nearly a decade of editorial work under her belt, Hannah made the jump to freelance editing.

##### MSWL

Middle Grade
 * Contemporary fantasy – something with humor and heart and, duh, magic!
 * Adventure – something like the Brendan Frasier version of The Mummy but with tweens
 * Animals – a beautiful emotional story that involves animals and will probably make me cry
 * Science Fiction - Character driven adventure stories that use technology in fun and engaging ways. Outer space settings!

YA
 * Fantasy – (dark, urban, contemporary, high&mdash;all of it!) I have a soft spot for reluctant heroes, who inevitable shouts, “I never asked for any of this!”
 * Horror – Ghosts, witches, vampires, and contagions are very much welcome
 * High concept contemporary – slow burn romances, girls supporting girls, friendship and friendship breakups, and self-love are some of my favorite themes
 * Science Fiction - Accessible science fiction. Think Star Wars or Marvel movies. I'm looking for a strong grounded story in which you do not need to understand the ins and outs of time travel and quantum physics in order to follow along
 * Thrillers - Stories with a tightly-knit, well-paced plot, clever and nuanced characters, and a twist that readers will never see coming.

Adult
 * Horror – Gothic, witchy, atmospheric elements in a dark and devious story
 * Fantasy – Bonus points if the MC isn’t the “Chosen One”

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

A killer first line is a must. I also like to have some sense of who the main character is/is going to be, some idea of the main thrust of the plot, and most of all an idea of the stakes.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writing is an inherently personal art, so I am always aware of what a privilege it is for me as an editor to be entrusted with an author’s story. It is an editor’s job to help make an author’s work shine, so I like to make sure that I have a clear idea of an author’s editorial vision, and then I come alongside to help bring that vision to life in the shiniest way on page. Editing is a collaborative effort, and I’m always available to freak out, brainstorm, and be completely in your corner when it comes to your story.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Revising is HARD, and I expect writers to put in the work. I expect writers to be open to criticism, be willing to kill their darlings, and be honest and transparent in their communication with me.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love traveling. Two of my favorite recent traveling adventures have been riding a camel through the Suq in Petra, Jordan, and feeding stingrays in the Cayman Islands!

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

Leigh Bardugo is queen! I love both her YA and her adult. Memorable characters? Check! Morally gray heroes? Check! Magic and creepiness? Check!
