***What kind of entries are you looking for in this contest?***

I’m looking for women's fiction, magical realism, literary fiction, literary thrillers, and psychological thrillers. I’m really hoping for entries that focus on modern family dynamics with strong feminist themes, especially from #ownvoices writers. I’m a huge fan of unreliable narrators, big twists, and deviations from the standard tropes that you find in Women’s Fiction. Give me fresh takes on affairs or power dynamics.

***What is your background in editing?***

I have been an intern for Entangled Publishing and literary agencies, have been a freelance editor since 2014, and am currently an editor and the Publishing Director for REUTS Publications.

***What can writers expect from working with you during the contest?***

A partner who is going to help you make your manuscript better. Editing a manuscript is where the writing process stops being a lonely one. So, from me, yes you’ll get a lengthy developmental editing letter. Be prepared for multiple pages of thoughts and suggestions, for me to pull at the strings of weak plots, and to call you out on lack of character development. But also expect someone who is going to help talk you through the editing process, who will brainstorm changes, and who will push you to be a better writer.

***What do you expect from writers during the contest revision process?***

Dedication, an open mind, and a willingness to collaborate. I don’t want a mentee that is going to fight me on every suggestion I make, but I also don’t want someone who is going to take my word as gospel, either. I want a teammate who will work with me during the five weeks while we get your manuscript ready for the agent showcase.

***What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?***

Horseback riding, expanding my wine and craft beer knowledge, and I’m learning how to do tarot card readings. When I really need to unplug and destress from everything, though, I (guiltily) play The Sims.

***What three books would you save in a dystopian future where libraries are banned?***

Rebecca Solnit’s _A Field Guide to Getting Lost_, Roxane Gay’s _Difficult Women_, Khaled Hosseini’s _A Thousand Splendid Suns_.
