I’m a sucker for stories with POC, LGBTQ voices. And extra brownie points for stories that focus on friendship love vs. romantic love. 

**Not On The List:**

No erotica, no romance. I’ve got no issues with the genre. It’s just not my genre and I think there are editors better suited for it. I’m not big on a lot of adult fiction, new adult science fiction or fantasy, or literary fiction. But I don’t want to pigeonhole myself&mdash;I mean, look at two of my favorite novelists: Octavia Butler and Haruki Murakami are adult scifi writers. And two of my top 5 last year were subs outside of my MSWL. What I’m trying to say is: genre is bs&mdash;if you’ve got a good story that you think I’d like, submit it.


##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Many earlier drafts rush to introduce several characters and plot details in the first 5. Slow down! Show me your hero’s life, show me something is amiss, creatively hint at the villain, and intrigue me as much as you do your hero.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’m a hands-on collaborator. Ideally, I would like to communicate with the writer to make sure I’m clear on all the areas that may be of concern, and present to them big picture changes that may be necessary as soon as possible. Changes in the first third of a manuscript can shake up the entire draft! With only five weeks in #RevPit, it’s important to make sure the writer is two steps ahead. I would like to implement weekly check-ins (via phone, Skype, or preferable Zoom) should the author be willing! If not, emails are cool.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I just expect writers to push themselves as hard as they can in this process. I expect them to be open about their thoughts and concerns over their manuscript, changes they have in mind, and the feedback and suggestions I give. 
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I’m very much into gaming. I’m practicing Japanese, and I participate in the _Broad Street Run_ every year. I have a budding vinyl collection, and cooking is a form of therapy for me. 
 
**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

_The Poet X_ shifted the way I wrote. I think Elizabeth Acevedo is an elegant, fluid writer whose words feel more like lyrics. I know many people have aversions to audiobooks, but I highly recommend _listening_ to _The Poet X_. And I implore you to listen to your own writing. Read it out loud. Have someone else read it aloud. Give your words some physical life, and it will open your eyes and your ears to the strengths and the weaknesses of your writing.
