This year, I’m only open to Middle Grade, books for readers ages 8-12. 

Middle Grade

 * Animal protagonists are surprisingly polarizing, but I am firmly in the pro camp!
* Contemporary
 * Stories of friendship, silly antics, and growing up
 * Evergreen themes: body positivity, self-love, coming-of-age, girls supporting girls, friendship and friendship breakups
* Fantasy (including contemporary fantasy and science fantasy)
 * Magical schools 
 * Stories inspired by myths, folklore, or legends
 * Stories that have both magic and cool technology
* Historical
 * Focusing on historically overlooked characters and time periods
* Horror or paranormal

* Science fiction
 * If you can compare to a superhero movie, I’m in
 * Aliens and the otherwise extraterrestrial very welcome

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

A strong character voice (doesn't everyone say that?)! I want to see an MC with agency, who happens TO the world rather than the world happening to them. I also want to see promise of conflict and what could happen if your MC fails (or succeeds) with their goals.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writing is inherently personal, so I am always aware of what a privilege it is for me as an editor to be entrusted with a story. It is an editor’s job to help make a writer's work shine, so I make sure that I have a clear idea of a writer's editorial vision, and then I come alongside to help bring that vision to life on page. Editing is a collaborative effort, and I’m here to freak out, brainstorm, and am completely in your corner when it comes to your story.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Revising is hard, and I expect writers to put in the work. I expect writers to be open to criticism, be willing to kill their darlings, and to be transparent in communication. 
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love baking. I also love critiquing contestants on cooking and baking shows from my couch, asserting my opinion like I'm Paul Hollywood.
