##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I want to see a main character with agency, who happens TO the world rather than the world happening to them. We're looking for *main character energy* here. I also want to see promise of conflict and what could happen if your main character fails (or succeeds) with their goals.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writing is inherently personal, so I am always aware of what a privilege it is for an editor to be entrusted with a story. It is an editor’s job to help make an author's words shine, so I make sure that I have a clear idea of the author's editorial vision, and then I come alongside to help bring that vision to life. Editing is a collaborative effort, and I’m here to freak out, brainstorm, and fangirl all over your story.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

The biggest thing for me is a willingness to kill your darlings for the sake of story if/where needed. I expect writers to be open to criticism and feedback and to be transparent in communication.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love baking. I also love critiquing contestants on cooking and baking shows from my couch while eating Cheetos, asserting my opinion like I'm Paul Hollywood.
