***What kind of entries are you looking for in this contest?***

Adult literary and contemporary fiction. I'm especially interested in mental health and/or satire. I'm not looking for YA or fantasy.

***What is your background in editing?***

I have a minor in creative writing and have edited for: _Her Campus_, _Contraposition_, _Persephone's Daughters_, and _Queen Mob's Teahouse_. I also edit novels on a freelance basis. 

***What can writers expect from working with you during the contest?***

They can expect an editor that looks at the big picture. What are you trying to say? Do the scenes flow seamlessly from one to the next? Is the premise interesting? 

***What do you expect from writers during the contest revision process?***

I expect writers who are passionate enough about their manuscripts that they are willing to kill a couple of darlings for the good of the story. I expect writers with a collaborative spirit.

***What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?***

(Is Tequila a hobby?) I'm a huge nerd. I take up OpenCourseWare courses for fun. I study Italian, Constitutional Law and Abnormal Psychology when I'm bored. 

***What three books would you save in a dystopian future where libraries are banned?***

 * _HOWL_ by Allen Ginsberg
 * _Winesburg, Ohio_ by Sherwood Anderson
 * _The Bell Jar_ by Sylvia Plath
