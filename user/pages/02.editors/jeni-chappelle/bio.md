##### MSWL

This year, I am accepting **fantasy and romantasy** in young adult and adult age categories. This includes crossover/new adult. Please read these specifics carefully. 

**PLEASE SEND ME...**
 * Subgenres I love: gothic, dark fantasy, science fantasy, romantasy, cozy fantasy, gaslamp fantasy, fantasy of manners, contemporary fantasy, urban fantasy, historical fantasy
 * I particularly want stories by authors from groups we need more of in publishing: BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, disabilities, neurodivergence, mental illness, and others that are still trying to get a seat at the table
 * Stories based on cultures and communities that are underrepresented in the market, specifically by authors from those communities

**DO NOT SEND ME...**
 * Epic fantasy
 * Novels in verse
 * Military-based or political fantasy. It's okay as a subplot, just not the main plot.
 * Toxic relationships (romantic or otherwise) you want the reader to support
 * Biblical retellings, biblical dystopian, or other Christianity-based stories

**FAIR WARNING!**
I am picky about these tropes or elements. It’s okay if your story includes these, but if they’re the main focus of the plot, it’s probably not for me. You're welcome to ask me about it, but if you still aren't sure, it may be best to choose other editors. 

 * Glorifying royalty/aristocracy
  * I don’t mind characters that are members of royalty or aristocracy, but there needs to be a heavy dose of scrutiny of that group. 
 * Dreams, visions, prophecies, journals, or diaries 
  * My concern with these is that they often take away from the agency of the characters, and when that’s the case, it can be too much to tackle for RevPit. 
 * Strict retellings of common classic American or British literature 
  * Tropes and broad strokes are fine, but I’m generally not a fan of retellings that use the same character or place names as the source material and/or follow the plot too closely. I often love re-imaginings. 
 * In a similar vein, book characters that come to life or real-life historical characters as main or important secondary characters 
 
**BOOKS I’VE LOVED RECENTLY**
 * _The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi_ by Shannon Chakraborty
 * _Assistant to the Villain_ by Hannah Nicole Maehrer
 * _Belladonna_ by Adalyn Grace
 * _Blood Debts_ by Terry J. Benton-Walker
 * _Bone Weaver_ by Aden Polydoros
 * _Divine Rivals_ by Rebecca Ross
 * _Emily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Faeries_ by Heather Fawcett
 * _She Who Became the Sun_ by Shelley Parker-Chan
 * _A Study in Drowning_ by Ava Reid	
 * _The Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels_ by India Holton

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

The first thing that catches my attention is a premise that combines concepts in interesting or new way. When I read pages, I start from the first word thinking about what this manuscript will need to be ready to query and how I might help the author accomplish that. Some of the elements I’ll be evaluating to determine that are voice, emotional engagement with the main character, conflict, and orientation to the MC’s world and story (including characters introductions, world building, backstory, exposition, etc). I hope to see that the author knows how to craft a scene and has a good grasp of the basics of storytelling. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

The goal is to create your best manuscript possible and maintain your vision for your book. A lot of authors are used to working alone on their writing, so I'll try to move us into a more collaborative space. You can expect aggressive encouragement and a heavy dose of (sometimes sarcastic, often inappropriate) humor. I’ll mainly focus on big-picture storytelling—plot, characterization, pacing, structure, etc.—and I aim to break that into manageable steps. We will also definitely discuss any problematic content I see, including lack of diverse representation or any potentially harmful representation. Early in the process, I’ll provide comprehensive feedback on the big picture. We’ll plan at least one call (probably phone or Zoom, but I'm also open to other kinds of communication if you're not a phone/Zoom person) to address any questions or concerns so you’ll have a clear direction on how to approach revisions. I am typically pretty quiet while I'm editing (during which you will have homework!), but the rest of the time, I will check in frequently and encourage questions. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I will guide the process but let my author set the pace and adjust where necessary to make sure we're working together as smoothly as possible. Ultimately, what makes that happen is openness on both sides. Getting edits can feel overwhelming, so I ask my author to keep an open mind and come to me with their questions and concerns. In return, I try to be as transparent as possible, really listen to my author, and guide our work together so we bridge any gaps in understanding. I am here to help you and want you to get as much from this opportunity as you can, but I never want anyone to feel stuck or intimidated by the process.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love audiobooks and video games—usually on PlayStation or Switch, sometimes on PC, and usually open world games are my favorite. Some of my favorites: _Stardew Valley_, _Breath of the Wild_, _Skyrim_, _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, _Horizon: Zero Dawn/Forbidden West_, _ACNH_, _Pokémon_. My favorite game last year was _Tears of the Kingdom_. I'm always looking for recs! Beyond that, I love hanging out with my family, including our pets (because, yes, they are part of the family).
