Jeni Chappelle is a freelance novel editor with twelve years’ experience, cofounding editor and board member for Revise & Resub (#RevPit), and EFA and SCBWI member.

##### MSWL

What I’m really looking for is impeccable voice, characters I immediately connect to, and a premise that excites me.

Some elements that really excite me:
 * Diverse voices, including (but not limited to) OwnVoices
 * Realistic, respectful representation of communities that are underrepresented in publishing
 * Strong, natural voice and compelling characters are a must.
 * Fresh plot or a new twist on old favorites
 * Genre mashups! Any combination of fantasy, sci fi, mystery, and historical is going to make me giddy.

Some specifics about genre and age category:
 * I am only accepting Upper MG, not Lower MG or chapter books.
 * I am not accepting military-based plots or Christian fiction.
 * For science fiction, I only want soft sci fi that's more focused on character than tech. 
 * For horror, I am only looking for horror that's related to paranormal/supernatural/fantasy/sci fi elements--the more speculative, the better. I don't want slasher-style horror or serial killers.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

I want to be excited about your plot and main character. In your query, I mostly want a strong idea of your overall plot, character arc, and stakes, stakes, stakes! In the pages, I’m looking for five elements to be handled well in a sub: voice (I know y’all hate reading that, but it’s true), starting with a scene already in progress, emotional connection to the main character, conflict, and orientation to the MC’s world and story (including characters introductions, world building, backstory, exposition, etc). I need to see that the author knows how to craft a scene and has a good grasp of the basics of storytelling.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

What’s most important to me is that we work together to create your best manuscript possible and maintain your vision for your book. My main focus for this contest will be big-picture storytelling&mdash;plot, characterization, pacing, structure, etc. So first I’ll provide comprehensive feedback on the big picture. We’ll plan at least one call (probably phone or Zoom, but I'm also open to other kinds of communication if you're not a phone/Zoom person) to address any questions or concerns so you’ll have a clear direction on how to approach revisions. I’m all about collaboration, so I’ll touch base frequently and be available via email for brainstorming and troubleshooting throughout the process.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Musts: frequent communication, commitment to hard work, and willingness to talk through suggestions you feel reluctant to implement. I am open to more than one round of edits if we have time and the author works hard on revisions. I’ll bring a lot of energy to this process, and I want an author who will do the same.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love to spend time with my family and my pets. I also like video games like Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Legend of Zelda series, and every LEGO game ever. I’m a big fan of live entertainment (if I ever get to see it again): theater, dance, music, comedy, burlesque…you name it. And I could never get enough of Disney World. 

**What was your favorite show to binge watch in the last year?**

_Schitt's Creek_! Highly recommend if you haven't seen it yet. It has the best character development I've ever seen on any sitcom, it subverts so many tropes, and there are some really clever, subtle elements that make it really genius. Plus, it's worth it just so you know the context of all the gifs!
