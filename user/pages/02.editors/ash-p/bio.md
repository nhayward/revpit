##### Bio

Ash P is the owner of Ash P Reads Editing Services. With a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, Education, and Mass Communication, and a previous career to early childhood education, she brings a unique blend of academic and creative expertise to her work.

Ash's passion for reading and discovering new words led her to a career in editing. When she began her journey as a freelance editor over two decades ago, freelancing was still a relatively unknown concept in Pakistan. Over the years, Ash has diligently honed her editing skills across a diverse range of genres, collaborating with several bestselling authors. She specializes in safe-for-work nonfiction and fiction.

Currently under the mentorship of a renowned comic book editor, Ash is expanding her expertise into new and exciting territories. She is particularly passionate about working with books for young readers and is eager to take on more projects in young adult (YA), middle grade (MG), and children's fiction, as well as graphic novels and comics.

**Pronouns: She/Her**

##### MSWL

I say YES to fiction and nonfiction manuscripts for all ages that are safe-for-work, clean, family-friendly, no/low-spice, closed-door romance stories—see how much I have stressed on this. I also say YES to comic books and graphic novels/memoirs scripts. I personally like my genres to overlap a bit, but manuscripts I will accept may be genre-focused or of combined genres in:
* Romance
* Comedy
* Paranormal
* Urban Fantasy
* Cozy Mystery
* Science Fiction
* Mystery
* Thriller
* Family
* Slice of Life
* Women’s Fiction.
* Horror (Only For Children's Fiction)

I enjoy stories where world building and character development are well constructed and carefully thought out. It shows that the writer has made the effort to create a world in which the reader can immerse themselves. I love stories that are wholesome. Tropes like friendship to romance, strangers to friends, #ownvoices, a journey of self-discovery, and overcoming hardships or estrangements provide me with a character I can root for. Write something new and unique and you’ve got my attention 100%.

I don't like lazy writing, and I do not work with manuscripts that have racism and religious prejudice, or depict toxic relationships as healthy.

I will automatically say NO to:
* Historical Fiction
* Open-Door Romance
* Explicit Sex Scenes and Language 
* BDSM and Erotica
* Violent Horror and Gore

Ideally, I prefer to work with manuscripts that range between 50-80k words. I am open to working with manuscripts of up to 100k if it's so good that I just HAVE TO READ IT!

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?** 

A manuscript must be able to engage my interest within the first page or two. A great hook, connection with the character(s), robust character development and world building with the promise of great adventure is sure to grab my interest. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Writers can expect honest feedback and I always like to be accessible to authors I work with. I will be available on Reddit and email. You can expect quick responses, unless I'm stuck in an emergency of some sort or then asleep due to the time difference.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I hope that the writers are open to constructive criticism and honest feedback. I work with a lot of new authors so I understand the need to be gentle with their book babies. I also like for them to feel safe enough to ask any questions and express any fears or thoughts that they have about their work. I'm not going to babysit you though, so I will require regular updates and a reasonably quick response to any queries I have.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I read a LOT of anything that catches my interest, be it fiction or nonfiction. I like learning new words and languages, and about new cultures. I watch a lot of sci fi, medical, and crime/detective TV shows and sci fi/fantasy anime. I collect stationery and knick knacks that inspire my creative spirit. I love spending time with animals and babies, preferably together. That's my most favorite thing in the world. I love travelling, though I don't do a lot of it anymore.
