##### Q&A

**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

Though it wasn't published _in_ 2018, I loved THE THING ABOUT JELLYFISH. I read it in 2018 and it really gave me the chills, seeing a MG voice with a depth like that. I also really loved SEAFIRE, as well, in the YA realm. Just the kind of kickass pirate girls the world needs!
