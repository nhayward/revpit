##### Bio

After receiving a BA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College, Kaitlyn refused to leave the concept of nightly homework behind. Centering her life around everything literary, she started her own freelance editing company, K. Johnson Editorial, as soon as her diploma arrived in the mail.

Kaitlyn is proud to be an apprentice agent with Corvisiero Literary Agency, as well as the Muse and the Marketplace Conference Assistant for GrubStreet, Boston. Check out her Twitter, [@kaitylynne13](https://twitter.com/kaitylynne13?target=_blank), for #MSWL listings and writerly life thoughts.

***What kind of entries are you looking for in this contest?***

 * I am open to NA and Adult in romance, contemporary, and historical fiction
 * I am looking for stories of close friendships, single or dual POV (male or female), LGBT, overseas locations
 * I am NOT look for paranormal this time around. I also don’t accept fiction with strong religious context or “love at first sight” storylines. I like to see characters grow along with the storyline
 * I want diversity, but not soapbox style. The message of the story should flow naturally without the characters having to force it into every interaction or conversation.
 * Give me something new in contemporary, find those subtle plots we don’t often see. Same with romance. I don’t want to see overplayed relationships where everything is stereotypically perfect or stereotypically falling apart. Challenge your characters, and I’ll love them.


***What is your background in editing?***

I was a literary magazine copyeditor from 2014-2016. I began my own business, K. Johnson Editorial, while I worked at codeMantra LLC as an academic copyeditor. Currently, I work as the Conference Assistant for GrubStreet, Boston, and I am also a Literary Agent Apprentice with Corvisiero Agency.

***What can writers expect from working with you during the contest?***

My method is a compliment sandwich, pointing out the good and then building on what can be done to help the manuscript further grow. I read through once, give developmental edits, then read through the second draft once finished and do line edits. Constant communication is what I strive for. An editor should be able to explain the reasoning behind certain edits, as well as hear a writer’s reaction to them. I also love sending nerdy gifs, so be prepared.

***What do you expect from writers during the contest revision process?***

I expect writers to be committed to two rounds of editing (developmental and line) and the availability to communicate about the manuscript, whether email, text, or video chat. What I DON’T expect is for a writer to take my edits, smile and nod, and simply scribble away. You should have passion for your manuscript and the process of making it great.

***What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?***

I love singing! My best friend is someone who will go with me to karaoke. I also love water activities like kayaking and water skiing.

***What three books would you save in a dystopian future where libraries are banned?***

 * _Fahrenheit 451_…because obviously
 * _Inkheart_…because my childhood self can never let go of that magic
 * _The Giver_…because history matters? I also love it and am apparently cliché
