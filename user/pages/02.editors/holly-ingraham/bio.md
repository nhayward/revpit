##### MSWL

As a reader, my interests vary widely, but my true editorial passions lie in working on romance, women’s fiction, mystery and YA. For this contest, I am especially looking for all areas of romance, cozy mystery, and strong, emotionally-gripping commercial women’s fiction. I tend to gravitate toward darker, emotionally-gripping YA and coming-of-age novels that leave me feeling punched in the gut.

I love a strong narrative voice, vibrant, jump-off-the-page characters, smart protagonists, a bit of humor, and stories that make me cry.

**Definitely Yes:**
 * Adult: romance (historical, contemporary, paranormal, romantic suspense), romcom, women’s fiction, domestic suspense, cozy mystery, suspense, thrillers, horror
 * NA: romance, romcom, coming of age, paranormal
 * YA: contemporary, romance, romcom, paranormal, dystopian, horror, thriller, suspense

**No:** fantasy, literary fiction, BDSM, magical realism, MG, non-fiction, non-consensual sex scenes

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Voice, voice, voice! A great opening line will always make me keep reading. I want to get a clear sense of both character and stakes right off the bat, and I am definitely hooked when the first inciting incident occurs within the first few pages. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I believe that publishing relationships thrive on collaboration and communication. My job is to help you create the best book possible. While I am flexible in my approach from author to author, I take that task very seriously, and I expect my author to as well. We will start by talking about the process and determining what approach will benefit you the most. Writers can expect me to be accessible to them via email and phone calls/video chats, quick to respond, and completely in their corner.  

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect my author to be ready to WORK and be open to constructive criticism and feedback. I need them to be open to discussing expectations, their process, and any concerns right off the bat, and then continue an open dialogue as we work together to get their book and query letter into tip top shape. Meeting deadlines is key. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I’m currently obsessed with expanding my culinary skills, finding the best one-pot meals, still making and canning all different kinds of jams and chutneys, exploring my green(ish) thumb with gardening and my growing indoor plant collection, slowly renovating our little piece of suburbia, working on improving my 5k time, and being mom to the sweetest, sassiest 5 year old twins I’ve ever met.

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER by Stephen Chbosky was a life-changing read for me in high school. I’ve found myself picking it back up over the years as I have grown and evolved, and I am transported back to my fourteen-year-old self and all the emotions and experiences of that time. The emotional impact is still so strong and powerful. Everyone needs to feel seen at some point. “And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.”
