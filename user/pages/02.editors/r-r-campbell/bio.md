##### MSWL

For RevPit 2018, Ryan is looking for **adult** in the below genres:
 * Sci-fi (excluding space opera)
     * I’ll be all over your manuscript if it features VR, simulations, or any takes on near-future technology.
     * Give me your sci-fi dystopias, too, please.
 * Speculative fiction
 * Magic Realism (pretty please?)
 * Fantasy
     * I’ll accept YA **in this genre only**.
     * Regardless of category, **in fantasy I’m looking for less traditional fantasy worlds and characters. Please no elves, orcs, dragons, etc.** It’s not that I don’t love these stories generally, it’s just not what I’m looking for in this contest.
 * Romantic Suspense
 * Manuscripts that blur the lines between genres
 * LGBT narratives and #ownvoices is a plus in any combination with the above

For RevPit 2018, Ryan is **not** looking for:
 * Middle grade (any genre)
 * Young adult (except fantasy)
 * Procedurals (police, legal, you name it)
 * Thrillers (military, spies, etc.)
 * Mystery
 * Romance (I’ll take lower-case “r” romance in combination with other genres, however)

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Any combination of the below will compel me to turn to page six and beyond:
 * Strong, unique voice
 * Goal-oriented storytelling (what does our protagonist want on the first page?)
 * Well-established setting
 * Dynamic dialogue
 
**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

It’s my goal to act as a resource and mentor throughout (and beyond!) the event. This includes answering questions, being a sounding board for new ideas, and making the editing process as dynamic and collaborative as possible. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in (and you’re submitting one of my preferred genres), definitely send your work my way!
 
**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I’m looking to work with someone who has a clear vision for their story, but who’s also unafraid to take a hard look at scene-level mechanics. It’d be great to work with a writer who’s interested in the same collaborative, dynamic process that I’m seeking.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Outside of writing, I play soccer, volleyball, and enjoy lounging about with my fiancée and our cats, Hashtag and Rhaegar. Oh, is wedding planning a hobby? Then that, too—at least for a few more months.
 
**What was your favorite childhood book and what did you love about it?**

A few titles come to mind, but let’s go as old school as I possibly can: _Yo! Yes?_ by Chris Raschka. What makes it old school? It’s literally the first book I remember being able to read on my own. I got it in elementary school at a Scholastic book fair—maybe the first one I ever went to—and, well, I’ve been reading books ever since, so it must have been a pretty good read!
