**What I’m Looking For**

For this year’s RevPit main event, I’m looking for the following in the adult, new adult, and young adult categories. 

 * Science Fiction
     * **Exceptions**
         * Space opera – if it’s in the vein of Star Wars or Star Trek, it’s not for me (even though I do love the former as a private citizen, so to speak).
         * Hard science fiction – if you’re heavier on the science than you are on the fiction (think Andy Weir’s The Martian), I’m afraid I won’t have time to get up to speed on the technical matters, which would take time away from my ability to edit for plot, characterization, theme, etc.
 * Fantasy
     * **Exceptions**
         * I’m not looking for high fantasy. If it’s got orcs, elves, or your take on hobbits, it’s not for me.
         * I will make an exception to the above point if these character archetypes are featured in urban fantasy. 
 * Urban Fantasy
 * Speculative Fiction
     * Anything that doesn’t fit tidily into either Science Fiction or Fantasy, but still has speculative elements. This could include but is not limited to alternate history and dystopian narratives.
 * Harrowing, intergenerational family tales
 * Magic Realism
 * Thriller
 * Suspense
 * Contemporary Fiction
 * Genre-blending narratives
     * Have a sci-fi romance? A science fantasy? Any other wackadoodle blend of misfitry that doesn’t fit tidily within a single genre? Send it my way!

**What I’m _Not_ Looking For**

I’m not going to be a good fit for the following and will not consider them.

 * Superhero stories (think Marvel or DC)
 * Horror
 * Mystery
 * Paranormal
 * Vampires
 * Middle grade or other children’s literature
 * Any submission with a word count greater than 100,000 words
     * Even if your manuscript looks like a great fit based on what I’ve posted in the “What I’m Looking For” section, this word count criteria will still apply. Given the degree of detail I like to provide in my feedback, there’s simply not enough time to tackle manuscripts of this length in time for the showcase.
 * Manuscripts that center around or feature suicide or suicidal ideation
 * Other exceptions as noted in “What I’m Looking For” above

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I want to be entranced. If you’ve got me deep in the REM sleep of a narrative dream from the start, you can bet I’ll be requesting additional pages. How do you dazzle readers so thoroughly in your opening scenes? If your prose matches the action on the page, if the pages are thick with an overpowering blend of mystery and suspense, and if you can crucially get that all-important inciting incident into those first five pages, you’ll be off to a good start.
 
**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Before the revisions process begins, we’ll speak by voice or video chat so I can be sure I understand your vision for the story. This is critical; it will help me best evaluate what deep-structure suggestions to make and which to withhold&mdash;unless, of course, you’re interested in the no-holds-barred, all-options-on-the-table approach, which I will gleefully accommodate.

Once we’ve synced up where those matters are concerned, I look forward to being in touch with the writer I ultimately work with at least once per week by voice chat. This will allow us to troubleshoot and brainstorm as a team regarding any tricky spots that might come up during the revisions process, while also ensuring we’re still working toward a unified vision for the story. We’ll also use this time to verify we’re working at a pace that makes you comfortable addressing the creative aspects of your work given the deadlines against which we’ll be revising.

I will also make myself available by email as much as possible to assist with unexpected twists and turns that might come up in between scheduled voice chats. Oh, and we can use both means of communication to celebrate when you conquer that one scene that’s been troubling you since draft one!

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Honesty is the best policy. This is your story, but it’s a collaborative effort. To collaborate effectively, I need to know you’re okay telling me when you think a suggestion of mine isn’t in line with where you see this story headed.

That said, flexibility and open-mindedness are also imperative. If you’re hoping to work with an editor who will read your manuscript and say, “Golly, this is pretty perfect. Maybe consider just a couple touch-ups of this, that, and the other,” I’m definitely not your guy.

Response time and general responsiveness are important, too. In an era of RSVP-ing “Going” on FB before bailing at the last minute, that won’t fly here. If we’re working together, I hope it’s because you’re serious about your work and really want to get your hands dirty. Things can, do, and will come up, but if we’re consistently rescheduling or skipping our voice chats, and emails are going days without being responded to, we’re not only shortchanging ourselves, but also every writer who applied to work with an editor but wasn’t selected to do so.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I wish I could say I had any.

Just kidding. I almost kind of do. When not reading, writing, or editing, I’m probably playing table tennis, baseball, or golfing on my Nintendo Wii. It’s still 2006, right?

I’m also getting back into music as of late. It’s been about ten years since I did anything meaningful in that realm, but I composed an original soundtrack for my most recent book trailer, and I’m looking forward to doing more of that in the coming months.

Oh, and I podcast! Admittedly, my podcasts are related to writing, too, but podcasting is technically not actually writing or editing, so I think it counts. I release three to four episodes per month featuring author interviews or conversations on craft with fellow RevPit editor Sione, which is always really refreshing.
 
**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

I kicked off 2018 by reading Mohsin Hamid’s _Exit West_. How much did I love it and why? Let’s just say I loved it enough to do an entire podcast episode about it centering on its use of point of view, head hopping, and voice. It’s honestly a magical book through and through. If you want to listen to me heap praise upon it for about a half hour, you can do so by listening to episode 002 [on this page](https://writescast.net/podcasts/bibliobreakdown?target=_blank).
