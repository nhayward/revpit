##### Bio

Caroline M. Tell is a freelance novel editor specializing in YA, fantasy, and romance. She's an avid reader and a writer of her own fictional stories. As an editor, her philosophy is to draw out the very best in her clients‚Äô works and to figure out what makes a story truly shine. Whether that's tightening up the prose, making sure the story makes sense, or simply keeping track of grammar and language usage, her goal is to help authors create stories  readers will love.

Before book editing, she worked as a freelance communications consultant for nonprofits and created content for two publishing websites that cover news and data within the trade book industry. She was a first-time RevPit editor last year, whose winner went on to getting a book deal. When she‚Äôs not reading clients‚Äô works or dreaming up new story ideas, she‚Äôs either drinking coffee, laughing with her friends, or watching k-dramas with her two fur-babies, Ollie and Teak.

**Pronouns: She/Her**

##### MSWL

This year, I‚Äôm looking for stories with unique worlds and magic systems. Whether that‚Äôs another planet, another realm, a different country, time period, or perspective, I‚Äôm open to them all! Of course, extra kudos if your story has a romance. Because I‚Äôm a sucker for a good romance ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è. I read and edit mostly YA, but I‚Äôm always opened to Adult and Middle Grade.

**Other elements I‚Äôm a sucker for:**
* Enemies to lovers
* Heists
* Lighthearted friendships
* Princesses falling in love but have other goals too
* Strong female characters
* Redemption arcs
* Male leads/love interests with dark pasts, but are huge softies on the inside
* Ghosts
* Adventures
* Magic/Sorcery
* Political intrigue
* Manipulation plots
* World-shattering revelations
* Multi POVs (think Six of Crows style)
* Handicap/Disability representation
* Characters that feel deeply about the world around them
* Retellings (of any kind, I‚Äôm not picky ‚úåüèª)

**Elements that are automatic no‚Äôs:**
* Excessive gore and violence (some okay if needed for the story)
* Excessive sex (again, some is okay if needed for the story)
* Body shaming
* Romances between non-humanoid characters
* Manuscripts over 90k words

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript‚Äôs first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

* A punchy first line/paragraph that dives right into the character‚Äôs head.
* Mastery over POV and has clearly defined goals, conflict, and character motivations.
* I can follow the character‚Äôs logic and reasoning smoothly without asking myself why.
* When the characters are doing something to go after their goals and are not just reflecting/thinking about them.
* When the story doesn‚Äôt start too early or too late.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

To me, storytelling is as much a creative art as it is a science, and part of ensuring that the creative flame in a story doesn‚Äôt go out is by sticking to the author‚Äôs original intentions. That‚Äôs why, when working with authors, I like to ask a lot of questions. I practice open communication and encourage authors to share their ideas, goals, and intentions for their story with me so that we can come up with better solutions to improve their stories in a way they and their readers will love.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I‚Äôm a very easy-going person who can work with just about anyone. I work best with writers who are passionate about the craft and improving their stories as well as displaying a level of professionalism that matches my own. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions they might have about my edits, the craft, or the editing process in general and highly encourage them to learn as much as they can. My favorite part about working with writers is coming up with new ideas and incorporating them into their stories.

Email is the best way to reach me. I do try to get back within 48 hours, but sometimes my multiple day jobs takes my time and focus away, so forgive me if it‚Äôs a little longer. After winners are announced, I‚Äôll be sending the winning author a questionnaire to fill out asking them about their project, goals, and intentions while working with me. I‚Äôm very happy to set up a Skype call to discuss the editorial timeline.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I enjoy lazy mornings drinking coffee, taking long walks with my dogs, working out, going shopping, or knitting (though I admittedly haven‚Äôt knit in a long time üòÖ). These days, you can find me working on my own creative writing projects or jet-setting around the world to meet my boyfriend in England or Japan.
