##### Bio

Tiffany Grimes is a non-binary writer, book coach, and web designer dedicated to amplifying marginalized voices through inclusive book coaching and design. They are the founder of Burgeon Design and Editorial and host “The Residency” an online writing community, and “Revision Alchemy,” an online self-editing course.

Tiffany grew up in foster care and was adopted at age 10, and their identity is shaped by their neurodivergence, high sensitivity, gender identity, and bisexuality, as well as anxiety and depression. Recognizing and sharing these facets of their identity is essential, as their proximity to privilege and degree of marginalization naturally impact the way they work with their clients and lead their community.

As a writer, Tiffany explores haunted families, stubborn identities, and the messy, beautiful ways people love and hurt each other. Originally from sunny Florida, where they were raised on gothic novels and sweet tea, Tiffany now resides in Oregon with their two cats. Their work has appeared in publications such as _Feels Blind Literary_, _Meat for Tea: The Valley Review_, _Microfiction Monday Magazine_, _The Fiction Pool_, _Sad Girls Club_, and _Herstry_. They write under the pen name Sawyer Elliot and are currently working on a gothic horror novel.

##### MSWL

I’m looking for manuscripts from underrecognized voices—stories that challenge, surprise, and resonate. I especially encourage submissions from LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC writers. Give me a voice that crackles on the page, characters who feel achingly real, and stories that experiment, take risks, and leave a lasting impact.

Accepting all genres and audiences. If your book has heart, depth, and something to say, I’d love to see it.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

For me, a manuscript’s first five pages need to make me care about the character and let me feel that something is starting to change. This isn’t just any ordinary day for them—something is beginning to shift, and the reader needs to feel that tug. It could be a quiet change or a sudden jolt, but whatever it is, it has to be clear that the character is on the brink of something new.

The voice needs to draw me in, to make me feel like I’m stepping inside the character’s world and seeing through their eyes. I want to connect with them immediately, to sense their inner world—their thoughts and feelings—as if they’re speaking directly to me. The voice should feel unique to them, full of richness and depth, so that I’m not just observing their life but feeling it alongside them.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

Our work together will be rooted in open communication. I’m committed to creating a space where you feel comfortable sharing your ideas, asking questions, and exploring new possibilities for your manuscript. You can expect clear, constructive feedback that’s both detailed and empathetic—focused not just on what needs to be improved, but on what’s working and how to build on it.

Throughout the process, I’ll be available to offer guidance and support, whether you need help with a specific revision or want to brainstorm through a larger issue. I’m here to listen, encourage, and collaborate. This is a partnership, and your voice and vision will always be at the heart of everything we do.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect writers to come into this process with openness—to feedback, to new possibilities, and to the idea that revision is where the heart of the story truly takes shape. My role is to support your vision while also helping you craft a story that resonates with readers, and that requires trust: trust that I see what you’re trying to create and that I’ll work with you to make it stronger in a way that aligns with your intent.

This is a collaboration, not just a one-way critique. I expect you to be willing to dig in, to sit with feedback (even if it feels overwhelming at first), and to approach revisions with curiosity and a growth mindset. Ultimately, my goal is to help you tell your story in the most powerful, compelling way possible. I’m here to guide, encourage, and challenge you when needed, but at the end of the day, this is your book. I expect you to take ownership of your revision process, trust yourself, and be willing to do the work to bring your manuscript to its fullest potential.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

When I’m not deep in a manuscript, you’ll probably find me thrifting for hidden treasures, drinking tea while watching truly terrible TV, or getting lost in the woods on a backpacking trip. I also love tarot, camping under the stars, and, of course, getting lost in a good book.
