##### Bio

Tiffany Grimes is a developmental editor and designer who helps writers flourish and bloom. She has her MFA from Hamline University in writing for children and young adults. Her writing has been published in Feels Blind Literary, Meat for Tea: The Valley Review, Microfiction Monday Magazine, The Fiction Pool, Ruminate Magazine, and HerStry. When she’s not editing or designing websites, she loves hiking, backpacking, sipping Earl Grey tea, snuggling with her cats, and just about every kind of craft.

##### MSWL

For this contest, I want only middle grade, young adult, and new adult! I want character driven plots, quiet stories (think internal conflict), queer characters, friends-to-lovers, enemies-to-lovers, diverse characters, anything \#ownvoices, geeky topics (ren faires, gamers, comic cons, etc), unreliable narrators, modern gothic, and magic everything (witches, school of magic, you name it).

Breakdown:
 * Young adult and new adult: contemporary, romance, historical (especially historical fantasy), fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian, magical realism, novels in verse
 * Middle grade: contemporary and sci-fi
 * I’m not a good fit for non-fiction, memoirs, or graphic novels
 * Nothing over 100k words (due to the contest limitations)

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Voice! I want to fall in love with the characters and root for them, even if they’re unreliable and flawed. I want to see the world through the protagonist’s eyes, not held at arm’s length.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’ll help make your vision of the manuscript come to life. I will discuss your goals and vision for the manuscript prior to editing. I’ll provide an overall assessment first, looking at big picture elements (plot, characterization, etc). I like to have a phone call after this stage to discuss how to implement these changes. Then, depending on how that round goes and what your manuscript needs, I’ll complete another assessment or complete line edits. I respond to emails within a day (except for during the weekend!)

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Excitement and communication! We’ll be spending a lot of time working on this manuscript, and there will be a ton of work to do (on both of our ends!) We won’t agree on everything and I’m more than happy to discuss why something isn’t resonating with you. We’re a team!
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I read tons, sew, craft, hike, bake, watch a lot of tv and movies, travel, and drink lots of tea.
