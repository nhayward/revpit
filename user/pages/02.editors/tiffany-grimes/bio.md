##### Bio

Tiffany Grimes is a developmental editor and writing coach who specializes in passion-driven editing. Her focus is not only on making a book the best it can be, but on helping her authors grow and learn with each revision. She’s a more hands on editor, focusing on a unique hybrid of editing and coaching. Her authors have gone on to self-publish and receive rep from literary agents. She loves editing contemporary, science-fiction and fantasy, dystopian, romance, historical, literary fiction, and speculative fiction.

She has an MFA from Hamline University in writing for children and young adults. Her writing has been published in Feels Blind Literary, Meat for Tea: The Valley Review, Microfiction Monday Magazine, The Fiction Pool, Ruminate Magazine, Sad Girls Club, and HerStry. 

When she’s not editing or designing websites, she loves writing, hiking, backpacking, sipping tea, snuggling with her cats, reading tarot cards, writing letters, and watching super great/terrible CW shows.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Voice! I want to fall in love with the characters and root for them, even if they’re unreliable and flawed. I want to see the world through the protagonist’s eyes, not held at arm’s length.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’ll help make your vision of the manuscript come to life.

First we'll have a Zoom chat to discuss your goals and vision for the manuscript. We'll also get to know each other and determine your individual needs. I tailor my editing to the particular client and manuscript needs, so I'll create a unique for you editing/coaching plan. I usually start with big picture elements first (plot, characterization, setting, worldbuilding, etc) and if time permits, we can dive deeper.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Excitement and communication! We’ll be spending a lot of time working on this manuscript, and there will be a ton of work to do (on both of our ends!) 

We won’t agree on everything and I’m more than happy to discuss why something isn’t resonating with you. We’re a team!
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I read tons, sew, craft, hike, bake, watch a lot of tv and movies, travel, and drink lots of tea.

**What was your favorite show to binge watch in the last year?**

_Julie and the Phantoms_! I’ve easily watched it a good 900x.
