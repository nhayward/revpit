##### Bio

A Texas native, Leah briefly moved to the East Coast to attend Rosemont College to pursue her dream of working in publishing. She graduated from Rosemont College with a B.A. in English and History and soon after became an agent at Ladderbird Literary Agency. Leah then went on to pursue and receive her M.A. in Publishing from her alma mater. Having accomplished her dream of working in publishing, she has since moved back to the South to begin her next adventure. Leah likes to spend her time enjoying the company of fictional characters more than people. But when not in the company of fictional characters, she likes to crochet, travel, hang out with friends and family, and catch up on the movies and tv shows she is always behind on.
