##### Bio

A Texas native, Leah briefly moved to the East Coast to attend Rosemont College and to pursue her dream of working in publishing. Now having graduated from Rosemont with her B.A. in English and History and having accomplished her dream, she has moved back to the South to begin her next adventure as a literary agent. In addition to searching for the next commercial YA or Adult project that will hook her (or make her cry), Leah is currently pursuing her M.A. in Publishing. Though an agent, editing is her first love as she has always been dedicated to helping authors develop their stories and produce their best work.

When not editing or working, Leah spends her time enjoying the company of fictional characters more than people and when not in the company of fictional characters, Leah hangs out with friends and family, cooks, travels, crochets, and catches up on the movies and tv shows she is always behind on.

##### MSWL

I’m looking for BIPOC YA/Crossover/Adult across the following genres:
* Contemporary/Romance
* Mystery/Thriller/Suspense

I love diverse and unique work that is fast-paced and has a complex cast of diverse characters. I love a good plot twist and am a huge sucker for camaraderie, banter, and the tight-knit, family-like group of friends trope. I'm pretty much a fan of all the tropes. 

I love a good romantic meet-cute, coming of age, and/or self-discovery story, especially in or post-college. Specifically, how one’s expectations drastically differ from reality or how a recent college grad is blindsided after entering the adult world, the working force, and how they slowly manage to navigate it and get on their feet. 

I'm also really interested in plots that deal with the struggles of today's online dating culture, about how couples deal with growth and life pulling them in two different directions, or how society’s views can impact interracial relationships. This can also apply to platonic friendships (especially F/F friendships) as I think they are affected in the same ways. I’d also love something realistic, raw, introspective, and family-centered. Think _To All the Boys I’ve Loved_, _Just One Day_, _Darius the Great Is Not Okay_, _Someone Great with Gina Rodriguez_, _Pose_, _Midnight Library_, and _The Vanishing Half_.

For mystery, thrillers, and suspense, I am here for unreliable narrators and dark academia! I’d also love something along the lines of _The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer_, _Behind Her Eyes_, _And Then There Were None_, _When No One is Watching_, _One of Us is Lying_, and _Sadie_. I’d also really love a heist in the veins of _Leverage_, _Now You See Me_, or _Six of Crows_.

**No's** for me would be MG, dystopian, fantasy, and non-fiction. Please no cliche romances where the plot is centered around cheating, parental disapproval, or high school drama. Give me something out of the ordinary, and conflict that’s hard-hitting and really makes me wonder if anyone is right.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I look for three things: voice, stakes, and worldbuilding. When the character's voice is really strong and is jumping off the page then I'm drawn in immediately. The stakes also need to be evident and extremely clear for me to understand the dynamic of what exactly I am getting into and rules of the world needs to be evident enough that I am not lost moving forward.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I'm dedicated to helping authors develop and produce their best work. I like to first look at the work as a whole and take stock of the big picture issues in terms of plot, character, worldbuilding, and organization. Then I like to go more in depth on each and brainstorm ways in which these aspects can be fleshed out and improved.

Partnership is my favorite part of being an editor so I'm more than happy to set up a Zoom call to brainstorm, but on the day to day you can DM me for quick questions and email for more in-depth questions that may require some thought.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Flexibility, openness, and enthusiasm! They should be open to and willing to act on constructive criticism and feedback. They should also know what areas in which they both need and want improvement. It is going to take more than one round of editing to get your novel ready so someone who understands that and is is ready to get to work.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Reading of course, haha! But in addition to that, I love crocheting, trying out new recipes, going for hikes, traveling, and catching up on all the TV/movies I'm behind on!
