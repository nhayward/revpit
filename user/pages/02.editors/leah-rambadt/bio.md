##### Bio

Leah Rambadt is a speculative fiction author and editor, and the owner of The Crafty Fox Editing Services. She received her MFA in Creative Writing from American University, and her publishing certificate from the Denver Publishing Institute. When she’s not busy dreaming up new characters or helping other authors create new worlds, you can find her geeking out over manga, anime, or the latest LEGO Creator set. Follow her on [social media](linktr.ee/leahrambadt) and subscribe to her email newsletter on Substack at The Crafty Fox: The Writer’s Corner.

**Pronouns: She/Her**

##### MSWL

**What I’m interested in:**
* YA: action/adventure, fantasy, dark fantasy, horror, soft sci-fi, contemporary, mystery, cozy mystery, thriller
* Adult: action/adventure, fantasy, dark fantasy, horror, soft sci-fi, contemporary, romance, mystery, cozy mystery, thriller

I love reading about characters with wholesome relationships, and those that start off with characters distrusting each other and gradually getting closer! I guess you could describe it as a strangers to friends trope. In terms of romance, I enjoy the tension of a developing relationship (both the friends to lovers trope and the strangers to friends to lovers trope) and, in contrast, romance stories that lean angsty and are full of misunderstandings.

In general, I’m drawn to main characters who are competent and confident—they know what they can do and how to use their skills/abilities to get what they “think” they want—and might be misunderstood by others. These types of MCs don’t necessarily have to be “good” either; they can be morally gray or viewed as “villainous” by other characters. Depending on the story, I also enjoy reading about meek MCs who become competent and confident as part of their character development.

**What I’m NOT interested in:**

Please DO NOT send me manuscripts longer than 100,000 words. I’ll automatically pass on high fantasy, historical fiction, and hard sci-fi.

I can handle body horror if it’s an integral part of your story, but gratuitous body horror and gore is a hard pass for me. I like horror and tension that puts me on the edge of my seat and/or makes me yell at the characters for the choices they make, not the kind that squicks me out.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Openings that immediately connect me to the story world and/or to the main character really catch my attention. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the opening needs to be action-packed exciting. In terms of story world, intriguing world-building can pique my curiosity. As for the main character, a strong voice, snarky dialogue, clever or competent behavior and actions, and/or the MC’s relationship with another character (wholesome or antagonistic) will definitely make me sit up and take notice of a manuscript’s opening!

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’m always happy and excited to help authors take their stories to the next level and make them shine! For a developmental edit, your editorial package will include your edited manuscript with comments, a detailed editorial letter, and something I call a Developmental Editing Name and Detail Tracking Sheet. It’s similar to a style guide, with a chapter breakdown included. The comments in your manuscript will include notes on ways to improve your story, and also point out areas of strength. The editorial letter will flesh out those notes more with actionable feedback for you to review before you start revising.

Email is the best way for me to keep in touch with indie authors I work with, and my chosen author can expect the same. I’m pretty low-key in terms of communication. Unless I have questions while I'm editing, I usually only reach out when I start an editing project, then a week before the editorial package return date just to let the author know everything is on track to be sent back on time, and then the return date for the editorial package. Basically, no news from me means that everything is going smoothly! 

However, I’m also open to setting up weekly email check-ins, even if it’s just to send an email saying, “The editing is going well!” If we set up a check-in, I expect a response back to my weekly email.

I don’t mind responding to questions or concerns about my editing process, or receiving emails that might better clarify the manuscript I’m working on—within reason. I expect authors to trust me with their manuscript and in my editorial process. I also expect them to remember that I have other commitments outside of editing their manuscript. I respond to an email within 24 hours of receiving one during the business week, and I expect the same of the authors who work with me. I probably won’t respond to any emails sent over the weekend!

By the end of #RevPit, you’ll have an editorial package with feedback that will help you tackle the revision process!

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

To me, any type of editing is a partnership between author and editor. We’re aligned on your vision for your story, you may or may not know which areas of your story need to be strengthened but you’re open to feedback, and you trust that my feedback will help you take your story to the next level. My chosen author is someone who is interested (and hopefully excited!) about getting constructive feedback on their manuscript. They may not agree with all of the feedback, but what they do agree with they are willing and able to incorporate into their story while they revise.

Again, email is the best way to communicate with me during the revision process. Indie authors I work with get 30 business days after their editorial package is returned to send me up to 10 emails to discuss my feedback and brainstorm a revision plan. The same will apply to whoever I work with for #RevPit! 

I recommend waiting at least 1 week after the editorial package is returned before reaching out to start talking about revisions. This will give you time to review the entire editorial package and digest my feedback. Given the tight schedule for #RevPit, I expect my chosen author to check their email more frequently, and to respond to emails from me within 24 hours during the work week. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

Other than reading, I love building LEGOs! I’ve built enough of the modular Creator sets to have a functioning downtown populated with minifigures, and smaller ones like the cherry blossom bonsai and a red fox. I’m also a big manga and anime fan. My favorite is _Jujutsu Kaisen_ (though I haven’t read past Volume 21!), my go-to comfort anime are _Gintama_, _Barakamon_, and _Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun_, and I tend to choose a couple of anime each season to watch on a weekly basis. For the fall-winter slate it was _Yakuza Fiancé: Raise wa Tanin ga Ii_, this slate it’s _The Apothecary Diaries_ Season 2 and _Sakamoto Days_.
