**Pronouns: She/Her**

##### MSWL

**YA:** fantasy, dark fantasy, horror, soft sci-fi, contemporary, mystery

**Adult:** fantasy, dark fantasy, horror, soft sci-fi, contemporary, romance, mystery, cozy mystery, thriller

I love reading about characters with wholesome relationships, and those that start off with characters distrusting each other and gradually getting closer! I guess you could describe it as a strangers to friends trope. In terms of romance, I enjoy the tension of a developing relationship (both the friends to lovers trope and the strangers to friends to lovers trope) and, in contrast, romance stories that lean angsty and are full of misunderstandings. In general, I'm drawn to main characters who are competent and confident--they know what they can do and how to use their skills/abilities to get what they "think" they want--and might be misunderstood by others.

Please **DO NOT** send me manuscripts longer than 100,000 words. I'll automatically pass on high fantasy, historical fiction, and hard sci-fi.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Openings that immediately connect me to the story world and/or to the main character really catch my attention. This doesn't necessarily mean that the opening needs to be action-packed exciting. In terms of story world, intriguing world-building can pique my curiosity. As for the main character, a strong voice, snarky dialogue, clever or competent behavior and actions, and/or the MC's relationship with another character (wholesome or antagonistic) will definitely make me sit up and take notice of a manuscript's opening!

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

For a developmental edit, your editorial package will include your edited manuscript with comments, a detailed editorial letter, and something I call a Developmental Editing Name and Detail Tracking Sheet. It's similar to a style guide, with a chapter breakdown included. 

Email is the best way for me to keep in touch with authors, though I'm open to hopping onto a Google Hangouts call before I start editing. I'm pretty low-key in terms of communication. Unless I have questions while I'm editing, I usually only reach out when I start an editing project, then a week before the editorial package return date just to let the author know everything is on track to be sent back on time, and then the return date for the editorial package. Basically, no news from me means that everything is going smoothly! 

I don't mind responding to questions or concerns about my editing process, or receiving emails that might better clarify the manuscript I'm working on--within reason. I expect authors to trust me with their manuscript and in my editorial process. I also expect them to remember that I have other commitments outside of editing their manuscript. I respond to an email within 24 hours of receiving one during the business week, and I expect the same of the authors who work with me. I probably won't respond to any emails sent over the weekend!

By the end of #RevPit, you'll have an editorial package with feedback that will help you tackle the revision process!

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Email is the best method of communication for me during the revision process as well. Authors I work with get 30 business days after their editorial package is returned to send me up to 10 emails to discuss my feedback and brainstorm a revision plan. The same will apply to whoever I work with for #RevPit!

However, I'm also open to hopping onto a Google Hangouts call about 1 week after the editorial package is returned. This will give you time to review the entire editorial package and digest my feedback. 

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I love building LEGO Creator sets! I've built enough of the modular sets to have a functioning downtown populated with minifigures. I'm also a big manga and anime fan, my current favorite being _Jujutsu Kaisen_. I usually scroll through Crunchyroll to find an interesting series to tune in for weekly updates. I also like watching action movies and docuseries that go into behind-the-scenes content or history.
