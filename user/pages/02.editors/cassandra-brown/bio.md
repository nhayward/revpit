##### Bio

The complete Ravenclaw package, EDITOR CASSANDRA earned her BA in English from Rochester College and her MA in Creative Writing on the Novel track from Newcastle University. She spent a few years as an agent intern before joining the staff for rights reversions and as a guide for self-publishing. Her international perspective gives her a unique view of the industry and she reads widely to stay abreast of the market. While she specializes in YA editing, she has experience in new adult and adult crossovers. She is thrilled each time projects go on to sell to publishers and top the NYT and USAToday bestseller lists. With a quick turn around time and experience you can trust, your work will be transformed into a book you can afford to be proud of. She can be found drinking tea and playing with her dog Mollie in Capac,MI, online at [editorcassandra.com](http://editorcassandra.com?target=_blank), and on twitter [@OnlyCassandra](https://twitter.com/OnlyCassandra?target=_blank).
