##### Bio

The complete Ravenclaw package, CASSANDRA BROWN earned her BA in English from Rochester College and her MA in Creative Writing on the Novel track from Newcastle University. She spent a few years as an agent intern before joining the staff for rights reversions and as a guide for self-publishing. Her international perspective gives her a unique view of the industry and she reads widely to stay abreast of the market. While she specializes in YA editing, she has experience in new adult and adult crossovers. She is thrilled each time projects go on to sell to publishers and top the NYT and USAToday bestseller lists. With a quick turn around time and experience you can trust, your work will be transformed into a book you can afford to be proud of. She can be found drinking tea and playing with her dog Mollie in Capac,MI, online at [editorcassandra.com](editorcassandra.com?target=_blank), and on twitter [@OnlyCassandra](https://twitter.com/OnlyCassandra?target=_blank).

***What kind of entries are you looking for in this contest?***

YA only. Love witches and adventures and end of the earth and space. Give me the weird, funny, scary, contemplative, love-stricken, and the books of your hearts. But please, no aliens, vamps/weres, or angels/demons. 

***What is your background in editing?***

BA in English, MA in Creative Writing, several years of experience at a literary agency, and a shelf full of satisfied, published author friends. 

***What can writers expect from working with you during the contest?***

Expect me to bring my training and experience to the table. I'll try my hardest to get your MS into the best shape I can in our limited time. Hopefully you'll come away having learned all you can about the strengths and weaknesses of your MS and we will have worked together on how to address any issues.

***What do you expect from writers during the contest revision process?***

I hope that you take this opportunity seriously and make the effort to work as hard as you can. It'll be intense, but you'll have me by your side. I promise that it will all be worth it!

***What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?***

I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd. I reread the books every chance I get. I make HP crafty things. I take naps. I play with my pup Mollie.

***What three books would you save in a dystopian future where libraries are banned?***

 * Jane Austen's _Northanger Abbey_ - (Historical YA, Yay!)
 * JK Rowling's _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_. 
 * Kevin Brockmeier's _The Brief History of the Dead_.
