##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice? **

Jump right in to the story. I want to experience something along with your character. There will be time for backstory and set up later. Use all of the five senses to really bring those pages to life!

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’m always available should you need a boost or help working out solutions via email or, preferably, Facebook messenger, as that's the quickest way to get my attention. We will focus first on the big picture, the developmental side of things, and then, if we have time, copy edits. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect my writer to put everything they have into this contest. We have a limited amount of time to make your work the best that it can be. You can sleep when the contest is over. Take every advantage of this opportunity that you can.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?** 

I've lost 185lbs over the last two years by eating keto and working out, practicing MMA, taking ballet classes, and doing daily yoga. I also love crafting, pretty and sparkly things, learning tarot, how to properly do my makeup and upkeep of my purple hair. I adore hanging out with my boyfriend.

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

_Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_. No matter how many times I read it (at least three dozen times so far!), I notice new things and the characters grow and change depending on what’s going on in my life at the time. Sometimes I feel more like Malfoy, sometimes like Sirius, and sometimes like Molly Weasley!
