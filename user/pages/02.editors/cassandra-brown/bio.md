##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice? **

Jump right in to the story. I want to experience something along with your character. There will be time for backstory and set up later. Use all of the five senses to really bring those pages to life!

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’m always available should you need a boost or help working out solutions via email or, preferably, Facebook messenger, as that's the quickest way to get my attention. We will focus first on the big picture, the developmental side of things, and then, if we have time, copy edits. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect my writer to put everything they have into this contest. We have a limited amount of time to make your work the best that it can be. You can sleep when the contest is over. Take every advantage of this opportunity that you can.

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?** 

I've been working on myself a lot lately. I've lost over 185lbs over the last two years by eating keto and working out, practicing MMA, yoga, and running my first 5k. I also love crafting; painting with acrylics, and generally MacGyvering pretty and sparkly things.

**What published book did you love in 2018, and what did you love about it?**

_Neverworld Wake_ by Marisha Pessl. It’s the perfect creepy beach read for when school lets out and you want an escape. It kept me on my toes, had twists and turns that shocked even me, someone who picks up on patterns and usually guesses the endings easily. There’s alternate timelines, Groundhog Day mind games, and amazing writing. Read it, you won’t be disappointed.
