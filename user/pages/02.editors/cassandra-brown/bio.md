##### Bio

The complete Ravenclaw package, EDITOR CASSANDRA, earned her MA in creative writing with a concentration on novel writing from Newcastle University. She spent a few years as an agent intern before joining the staff for rights reversions and as a guide for self publishing. Her international perspective gives her a unique edge in the industry and she reads widely to stay abreast of the market. While YA is where her heart lives, she also has experience in NA and adult crossovers, as well as upper middle grade. She is thrilled each time projects go on to sell to publishers and top the NYTimes Bestseller lists. With a quick turnaround time and experience you can trust, your work will be transformed into a book you can afford to be proud of. She can be found in drinking tea and playing with her dog Mollie in Capac, Michigan.

##### MSWL

YA is where my heart lives. I accept all genres. Love witches and adventures and end of the earth and space. Give me the weird, funny, scary, contemplative, love-stricken, and the books of your hearts. But please, no sexy aliens, vamps/weres, or angels/demons. Will also accept NA, adult crossovers, and upper MG.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice? **

Jump right in to the story. I want to experience something along with your character. There will be time for backstory and set up later. Use all of the five senses to really bring those pages to life!

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I work odd hours, preferring those quiet moments when everyone else is asleep. But if I’m up, I’m always available should you need a boost or help working out solutions.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I expect my writer to put everything they have into this contest. We have a limited amount of time to make your work the best that it can be. You can sleep when the contest is over :P

**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?** 

I love crafting. I make things out of felt, paint with watercolors and acrylics, sew, and crochet. I’m also getting into working out, taking MMA classes and doing some walking and awkward running. I’ve lost 150 lbs over the past year and getting active is something I now enjoy.

**What was your favorite childhood book and what did you love about it?**

Oddly enough, I read Dean Koontz’s _Sole Survivor_ as a kid and fell in love with it. I must have read it a dozen times. I even performed the poem from the Book of Counted Sorrows at the start of it in a school talent contest. I can still recite it. I think it was the first novel I read that I actually understood, having lost my mom and yearning at that age to be extraordinary. This book ticked all those boxes.
