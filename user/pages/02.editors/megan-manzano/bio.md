##### Bio

Megan fell in love with reading and writing from a young age. She grew up to receive a BA in English with a minor in philosophy; eager to stay as close to books as possible. She has and continues to wear many hats in the publishing world: freelance editor, writer, a marketer for Trade books and now an Agent at D4EO Literary Agency. In her spare time, she’s either traveling, hiking, snuggling her dog, or binge-watching television shows.

##### MSWL

 * Dystopian / Apocalyptic
 * Space Operas
 * Futuristic Societies
 * Steam Punk / Cyber Punk
 * Virtual Reality

Contemporary – For both MG & YA
 * Dark Contemporary
 * Contemporary Fantasy
 * Romance 
 * Character driven stories or stories with quieter stakes 

Fantasy – **I WILL ONLY ACCEPT FANTASY FOR MG**
 * Retellings
 * Magical Realism
 * Speculative Fiction 

**What I Won’t Accept**
 * Stories with graphic animal abuse or centered around animal abuse
 * Graphic novels, chapter books, or picture books
 * Stories involving exorcisms, hauntings, possessions, and similar paranormal elements.)
 * Historical Fiction 
 * Nonfiction 

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

I’m a huge sucker for voice. If I can feel a character come alive within the opening, then I’m usually 100% eager to read more. 

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I’d consider myself a cheerleader for the stories I love. I want to push writers so they can get the words on the page as close as possible to what’s in their heads. I’m a very open and communicative person so I encourage questions, ideas, and new routes you think will help your work as we go forth. Any feedback I provide will not be given without explanation and if there’s ever a question about my feedback, I’d want to have a discussion about it so we’re on the same page.

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

I want writers to be open and honest with me about their work as well as any concerns they have about revisions. Getting into RevPit means working on a schedule so any writer I work with should be able to handle deadlines and be ready to dive into their story, pick it apart, and piece it back together. 
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

I enjoy hiking and thankfully there are tons of beautiful trails not too far from where I live. It’s a great way to disconnect for a few hours while also taking in some scenic sights and tiring out my dog. 

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

My favorite book will always be _The Perks of Being a Wallflower_ by Stephen Chbosky. I read it at a very difficult time in my life as a teenager and it was brilliant at pointing out everything I felt while also saying it was okay to not be okay. Whenever I’m feeling low, I’ll bust out that book, even if it’s just to skim a few sections from it.
