##### Bio

Megan fell in love with reading and writing from a young age. She grew up to receive a BA in English with a minor in philosophy; eager to stay as close to books as possible. She has and continues to wear many hats in the publishing world: freelance editor, writer, a marketer for Trade books and now an Agent at D4EO Literary Agency. In her spare time, sheâ€™s either traveling, hiking, snuggling her dog, or binge-watching television shows.
