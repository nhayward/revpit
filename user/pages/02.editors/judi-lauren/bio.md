**What I’m looking for:**

This year I’m taking both YA and MG. In both categories I’m looking for:

 * Contemporary—I love dark, angsty stories. I love mystery and thriller and romance (your book doesn’t have to have romance for me to pick you.) I love realistic contemporaries that show the gritty side of life. I don’t shy away from abuse/assault stories, as long as the crimes are shown as being wrong. I’m very up for dark subject matter: kidnappings, trafficking, death, abuse, torture, runaways, etc. I sound like a sadist, but send it to me!
 * Fantasy—For fantasy, I want pretty much the same as contemporary (especially the dark subject matter). My favorite fantasy books are ones that are very character driven, like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. Epic fantasies are not right for me.
 * Low sci-fi—same thing as fantasy (with dark subject matter). I love, love stories that are character driven, so give me characters I will fall in love with. Think I Am Number Four.
 * Basically, I’m very open to a lot of things. I’m open to characters with disabilities, LGBTQ themes, characters of different races, etc. AND if you have a book that’s dark, but also humorous, I’m more than up for that, as long as I can fall in love with the voice.
 * I’m a fan of layered characters that have to make difficult choices but have the voice that’ll make a reader still love them. I love strong characters who pop off the page and leave me wanting to read more into their lives, even after the book is over. I am definitely fine with language, sex, and violence, but your characters don’t have to do all these things to make me love them. 

**What I won’t read:**

So this will be a short list.
 * Don’t send me a book where a little boy dies. If he’s older than like 13 and dies, that’s fine. Younger than 13 and he dies, I don’t want to see that. I’m fine to see them hurt or in peril, but if he dies, you’ve lost me.
 * I’m not the best for books that revolve heavily on sports. If your character is part of a sports team, but it’s not the main focus of the story, I’m up for that. If it’s a big part of his/her life but not THE biggest part, I’m up for that too. Think the characters of One Tree Hill.
 * Lastly, nothing with a preaching message. I don’t read to be taught some kind of lesson, so please don’t submit books like that to me. This includes books that are based on any type of religion (if your character is religious, that’s fine, but I don’t want a book where that’s the sole focus.) This also includes books based on the political climate. IF you have a book based in the political world (for example: two senators’ kids with a forbidden love) that’s totally fine.

##### Q&A

**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**

Characters. Voice is big for me too, but I want characters that come off the page, ones I can root for from the beginning. I want them strong, flawed, and holding a lot of agency. I don’t want things just happening to the characters, they need to be making the story move along.

**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**

I take my writer cheerleading very seriously. I’m always going to be honest when we talk about your book, and I promise to say it in a way where it doesn’t feel like I insulted the project you’ve been working on for months. I’ll start with an in-depth edit letter focusing on big picture issues in the manuscript. After you’ve had a chance to read over it, I like to do a video chat where we discuss the letter and brainstorm ideas on how to implement the changes. I’ll most likely be reading the manuscript at least twice before the round of edits is up. I usually respond within a day to emails. 

**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**

Dedication. I’ve worked with some truly amazing writers, ones who took my edits and turned their books into something even sparklier than they were before. I’m going to be giving 110% in edits, and I want to get that back from the author. We’re going to have so much fun, because it’s the best to gush about books, but this will be a lot of work, and you should be prepared to make major changes to your story if it’s called for.
 
**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**

So many. But my top two are crocheting and home renovation projects. If you’re on my Instagram, you can find a picture of a Supernatural blanket I crocheted for one of my favorite people.

**What is your favorite book to reread, and why?**

Ohhh this was hard, but it’s an actual tie between _Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe_ and _The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue_. Aristotle and Dante is my favorite “growing up” story. I felt like it perfectly captured how it feels to be a teen, turning into an adult. And Monty in Gentleman’s Guide is a character I personally related to on a deep level. Plus it’s just a super fun story!
