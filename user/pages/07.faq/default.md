## Annual Contest

#### **The submission process**

<div class="faq-accordion" markdown="1">

##### Q: How many manuscripts can I submit? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Only **one** submission per entrant. 

</div>

##### Q: If I've won another contest, can I enter? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Yes! If you've won another contest or one of our mini events, you are eligible to submit to our Annual Contest. However, past Annual Contest Grand Prize winners cannot enter again for two years after they've won, and it cannot be with the same manuscript.

</div>

##### Q: How many submissions will each editor accept? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** There is a cap of 100 submissions for all editors. After an editor receives 100, the rest of their submissions will go to the alternates chosen by the authors.

</div>

##### Q: Why do I have to pick an alternate editor? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Just in case one of your editor picks caps out, we want to make sure your submission is still being seen by two editors.

</div>

##### Q: How do submissions need to be formatted? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Your query letter and pages will be uploaded in **one** document to our submission form. 

Query letter: 
 * Less than 1 page long
 * Use a generic greeting, as the same letter will be seen by both of your chosen editors.
 * See our [Sample Query](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/sample-query) for inspiration!

Pages:
 * Pages should be in Word doc format, double-spaced, with one-inch margins and a standard font (Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman, 11 or 12 pt).
 * Do not include a title page; the pages should begin with your first chapter or prologue.
 * Five double-spaced pages is approximately 1250-1500 words.
 * Make sure your pages end on a complete sentence. 

</div>

##### Q: What needs to go into my query letter? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** We have [a post](http://reviseresub.com/showcase/writing-a-really-excellent-query-and-an-announcement) about this from RevPit editor Kyra Nelson. 

</div>

##### Q: What goes into the bio of my query letter?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Here’s a [great article](http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/what-should-you-write-in-the-bio-paragraph-of-a-query-letter?target=_blank) that goes into detail. If you don’t have any writing credits, just a few short sentences about yourself are preferred. 

</div>

##### Q: What if my first pages go over the word count?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** No more than 1500 words, please.

</div>

##### Q: Is there a word count for answers to the questions on the submission page?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Not at all! But try to keep it to less than 500 words per question. 

</div>

</div>

#### **Choosing editors**

<div class="faq-accordion" markdown="1">

##### Q: How do you pick which editors to submit to? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Editor wish lists will be available soon with their bios on the [Editors page](http://reviseresub.com/editors), so do your research before the submission window opens. If you’re looking for clarification on what a specific editor is looking for, stop by during their #AskEditor [sessions](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/schedule) on Twitter or @ them using the #RevPit tag. 

</div>

##### Q: Why can authors only pick two top choices for editors this year?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** If you participated in #RevPit last year, you might notice that we made the switch from three to two editor choices per participant this year (you’ll still get to choose an alternate). This gives everyone the best shot of being assigned to their first choice of editor.

 * With fewer editor selections, authors can focus on the most compatible options.
 * Editors will reach their entry cap slower, giving more authors a shot at their top picks.
 * With early entrants each taking two, rather than three, of the early slots, there’s a better chance that later entries will get to their intended editors.

#### **Additional materials**

<div class="faq-accordion" markdown="1">

##### Q: If an editor wants to see additional materials, what will they request?

<div markdown="1"> 

**A:** Each editor may request something different; it is entirely up to them. Participating authors need to have their query letter, complete manuscript, and a 1-2 page (500-1000 words) single-spaced synopsis ready by the first day of submissions. 

</div>

##### Q: What needs to go in a synopsis?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** [This post](http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/mastering-dreaded-synopsis?target=_blank) by RevPit editor Kaitlyn Johnson explains. Editors may not provide feedback on your synopsis. They mainly need it to see the plot and character development in your ms.

</div>

##### Q: What should the total word count for my novel be?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** [This post](http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/word-count-for-novels-and-childrens-books-the-definitive-post?target=_blank) explains industry standards for word count. If your word count is too high or too low, it won’t disqualify you, but that is one element the editors may take into consideration.

</div>

##### Q: When and how will editors request additional materials?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Editors may request additional materials at any time between April 6th and April 13th. Editors will announce on Twitter when they have sent all requests for additional materials. Requests will be sent via the email you use to log in to your Submittable account. 

</div>

</div>

#### **Feedback**

<div class="faq-accordion" markdown="1">

##### Q: What is #10Queries?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** #10Queries sessions are when editors will tweet anonymous feedback on some of the submissions they’ve received. For more information on #10Queries, check out [this post](https://katiemccoach.com/how-an-editor-sees-it-10queries?target=_blank). 

</div>

##### Q: When will editors tweet #10Queries?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** #10Queries sessions will take place on Twitter **April 6-13**. Watch your chosen editors’ Twitter feeds and the #RevPit feed for updates on when editors will post their #10Queries feedback.

</div>

##### Q: When will editors send feedback? Will everyone receive feedback? How will they send it?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** All editors will send feedback to the authors they request additional materials from but are not required to send feedback to authors from whom they do not request additional materials. Any feedback will be sent via email to the email the authors used to sign in to their Submittable account. As this contest is very labor-intensive, some editors may take some time to get back to you. Try not to worry!

</div>

##### Q: How and when will winners be notified?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Winners will be announced on the [Showcase page](http://reviseresub.com/showcase) of our site as well as on Twitter on **April 15th**. Editors will then email their authors to begin the editing process!

</div>

##### Q: Can we work with the editors even if we don’t win? 

<div markdown="1">

**A:** Yes, all editors are available for hire, but their availability and pricing vary. Reach out directly.
