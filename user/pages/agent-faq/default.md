### Agent FAQ

Welcome agents! If you're here to request from our authors, here is a link to [the showcase](https://reviseresub.com/showcase). Or you can go directly to our [request form](https://forms.gle/ttzaGQHoahEnkN6h6?target=_blank).

A little about our contest: Revise & Resub (#RevPit) supports authors with an annual contest wherein querying authors can win feedback and edits on their full manuscripts from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for agent inboxes. At the end of the editing we showcase all the work our author/editor pairs have done.

##### Q: What is \#RevPit?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** \#RevPit is a contest where winning authors receive feedback and a developmental edit on their full fiction manuscript from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for the next step on their publishing journey. Not only are authors immersed in a supportive community of their peers, they also have the chance to learn more about how their story fits into the industry and obtain understanding of why different edits matter and how to continue practicing them in the future.

##### Q: Who are the editors?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** RevPit prides itself on our extensive vetting program. Each of our editors have gone through several rounds of evaluation to ensure they meet industry standards. To meet our editors, please [visit the editors page](https://reviseresub.com/editors).

##### Q: How do I view the winning manuscripts?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** All winning manuscripts will take part in our Showcase event, where you can peruse sample pages and author information. [Click here to view the Showcase](https://reviseresub.com/showcase). The Showcase will remain live for three months.

##### Q: How do I request additional material?

<div markdown="1">

**A:** In order to officially request additional material, all agents and acquiring editors must use the form located at the bottom of each showcase entry. All requests will then be forwarded to the writers in question.

We at \#RevPit know that competition can be fierce, but we ask that each participating agent and acquiring editor adhere to the request process. Our winners are encouraged to share the links to their showcase material on social media. If you ‘like’ an entry on social media, please be sure to request via the form on the official showcase page for that individual author. We can’t ensure that the author in question will interpret your ‘like’ as an official request.
