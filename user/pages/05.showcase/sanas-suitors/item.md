### Query

For hijab-wearing Sana Khan, finding love has been like bad game of Russian roulette, with each choice worse than the last. But that hasn’t stopped her mother from setting up a string of potential suitors like a glorified Bollywood show. Except they never end with her in a meadow dancing in the monsoon rains with the perfect man. Eventually, her mother gives her an ultimatum: find a mate and quick. To buy time, Sana asks her friend Adam to be her fake fiancé. 

But just when she thinks she’s got things under control, enter Daniel, her new boss, who is hotter than any Bollywood heartthrob and sets her heart beating in a familiar rhythm. A rhythm she had known years ago. He reminds her of someone she loved a long time ago.

Then, to her surprise, Adam declares he’s in love with her and proposes for real in front of her family. Now she has a choice to make: play the part of a perfect desi daughter or follow her heart. Whatever she chooses, someone is going to get their heart broken.

Appealing to readers of Uzma Jalaluddin’s _Ayesha At Last_ and _When Dimple Met Rishi_, SANA’S SUITORS is a 100,000-word #ownvoices women’s fiction novel with a strong romantic arc and is told in dual POV. At its heart, SANA’S SUITORS is an immigrant story highlighting complex family dynamics. Some of the experiences in the book are based on my life living as an immigrant in New Jersey.

### First Five Pages

Chapter 1

The bell above the cafe door jingles as Aneela and I step into the cafe, and a heady concoction of smells—freshly brewed chai, baked pies, and spices—tickles my nostrils. We hang our coats on the cast brass rail hooks in the small nook near the entrance. The tables are laid out with vintage pictures of the old city and wireless charging stations in each of them. I steal glances at Adam, the owner. His smile lights up his hazel eyes, contrasting with the dark apron branded with the shop's Tea-se logo. They dart to the customer to take an order. It's our chai spot for the last few months, ever since this café opened in downtown Trenton.

"Sana, stop drooling," Aneela whispers. "Make out with him already. You're killing me with this drool-but-don't-touch rule."

Although we've been friends all our lives, Ainee still forgets my reservations about dating and mating. "I don't watch him longingly. Besides, Ammi will scare him off with choice desi _galiyan_." Swear words are not a common occurrence in the Khan household but bringing him home might warrant it. His tattooed wrist alone might put her off. But I value Adam's friendship. His kind eyes and patience when I whine to him about work, world, and things in my life that need fixing but are beyond my control are endearing. Ainee is a great friend when she’s not self-absorbed. He is as even keeled as they come. A must for my over-anxious self. 

"Your mother will give him fifty tongue lashes before serving him chai. But, you're too much of a chicken to bring him home. He's adorable. If I didn't have this..." She points to the sparkler on her ring finger. "I'd drink his chocolate chai."

The picture she paints of Ammi is bleak but accurate. "Only an act of Allah will force me to introduce him to Ammi. But we're here because his new business cards came in and he's saved a few for us."

"Us? He means you." Aneela jabs her index finger at me.

The cafe is abuzz with customers lined up for pastries and drinks. Adam peers up at us and a huge grin lights his face. He takes us our orders and points to an empty table set for four.

Aneela slaps my hand. "Are you going to ditch me again this Friday for your weekend suitors?"

"You don’t get it, do you? Online dating is the same, except it’s arranged dates through an algorithm." I chew my bottom lip.

I shake my head to erase the memory of the last disastrous samosa meet-and-greet when my mother's friend and her son came over. Not that I am expecting Fawad Khan to jump off the movie screen with a bouquet of flowers and his mother in tow for a marriage proposal. But none of these rishta proposals, however, felt right. Rishtas are basically a blind date on a different level—proposals with both families in tow. They are facilitated by an overly nosy—or, as Ammi likes to describe them, ‘concerned because your daughter is nearly thirty’—aunties, or family friends. Problem is I lack two basic qualifications to be a top candidate like my older sister. I’m not fair skinned like her and I’m past the age of twenty-one. Which is considered prime age to be married. I do wish there was a way to skip past this and get to be where my parents were.

I want what Ammi and Abba had. My parents had an arranged marriage, and it lasted until my father passed away a few years ago. They had a good marriage, but they never gazed lovingly into each other's eyes. Okay, maybe when Ammi had something in her eye. But they had this partnership, this friendship and trust that lasted through three kids, immigration to a new country with two suitcases and a dream, and a failed restaurant business.

"Well, your Ammi's algorithm keeps picking all the wrong desi boys. It’s only Thursday, I’m sure her ‘Come home this weekend’ text is on its way soon." Aneela arches a single eyebrow, a gesture I covet more than mango ice cream.

Ainee, in between finding proper lighting for her selfie, nudges me to talk to Adam. She’s engaged to a swoon-worthy tech genius and crazy in love. She's gorgeous and tall, unlike five-feet-three invisible me. _Le sigh_. She has over seven thousand followers on Instagram. My own family doesn't follow me online. They like following, but only in real life.

Aneela posts her latte selfie, and within seconds her phone pings multiple times. Mine pings too, but it's Ammi. _Don't forget about the rishta this weekend_.

"Got forty likes already!" Aneela squeals. Her peach lip gloss glitters in the light, and her hoops move when she fixes her pashmina wrap around her shoulders.

Perhaps it's too late to improve on my oversized green sweater and make-up free face. I should've tried for a matching hijab. The truth is this is the only clean hijab I could find this morning. And it's blue.

I check my reflection off the shiny tables. Does the world around me see what I see when I look in the mirror? Do I seem oppressed? Backward? Being brown is different, having my faith on display even more so.

"Salam Aleikum, ladies." Aneela's fiancée, Saif, waves then joins us at our table.

"Waleikum salaam, jaan." Aneela hugs her beau.

Saif rubs her shoulder and kisses her forehead. "Are you okay?"

She stares into his eyes and hooks her arm through his.

I clear my throat. "Do you need me to leave? Give you two lovebirds some privacy?"

"Nah, can't be a traitor to my best and very single friend. You're lonely." She winks. "I need to fix that."

“I’m twenty-eight, although by Ammi’s standards I’ll soon descend into the doomed thirties. The age of no good proposals.” My impending spinsterhood is a subject that screams to be changed. "So...when's the big day, Saif? Or are you two eloping?"

"Summer." He squeezes Aneela's hand.

Saif moves over to take a phone call, and Ainee flicks her hair then waggles her eyebrows at me. "Did you hear the news fresh out of the desi auntie network?"

I shrug. "Ah, the desi network. The auntie brigade knows things that poor Sherlock would be amazed at, but I cannot be bothered by them. "

"This one's about _him_." She fixes her gaze on me. "Shahida auntie is back with her accomplished sons. She's making amends." She leans in a bit. "He's here as well."

He is here as well.

I let that sink in. The Khalil family is back in town. Shahryar Khalil was the boy I spent countless summer evenings playing with, the one who is forbidden. His whole family is  estranged from mine. Ammi's words were, “I'll die before I let them step inside my house.” Stern words with a singular purpose. Half of me is dreading a public meeting, another is curious how they’ve grown. How he’s grown. Until that day we were the best of friends and inseparable. 

And now he’s back in town.
