\#RevPit winner and 2022 Stiletto Contest finalist THE SECOND CHANCES PLAYBOOK is a women’s fiction/rom-com crossover with the steam of Emily Henry, the unconventional second chance and snark of YOU DESERVE EACH OTHER, and the intergenerational female friendships of TED LASSO. Complete at 92,000 words, it is a standalone novel with series potential written from the lived experience of a bi/autistic writer.

Awkward try-hard Liz Lewis abandons her 30th birthday party after a rock-bottom realization: she’s burned her twenties with neither love nor accomplishments to show for them. In the boisterous world of wilderness expeditions, only game-players get C-suites, while introverted Liz gets spreadsheets. At home, her extroverted husband Tobin would rather believe in their fictional perfect marriage than acknowledge the smoking wreckage of their lives. The relationship’s a write-off, but if Liz can remake herself into a smooth-talking, golf-playing leadership type in eight weeks, she might squeak through the upcoming company merger – and downsizing – with one last shot at launching her career.

Liz’s (well-researched) plan: a crash course in surviving any social situation via improv comedy class. The catch: she’s predictably terrible at it. Worse, her only option for the extra practice she needs is Tobin. Desperate not to recreate his parents’ volatile marriage, he proposes a self-help book based on Liz’s beloved romcoms…and improv. Liz doesn’t share his faith in second chances, but now she can steal his extroverted secrets right from the source. 

As Liz and Tobin’s intimacy regrows one bonkers scenario at a time, she’s forced to confront the roles that trapped her and the parts of herself she held back. But as she comes into her own at work, her prospects seem rosier but her choices grow thornier. If she wants her marriage to continue after the book ends, she’ll have to reckon with the hardest scenario of all: how much she’s willing to gamble on her dream, when love is the collateral.

### First Five Pages

**Chapter 1**

_“Action begins with the disruption of a routine.”_ - Keith Johnstone, Loose Moose Theatre

The first minute of my thirtieth birthday party is everything I want it to be. 

My mother-in-law’s house spills noise and warmth when I ease open the front door. Gusts of laughter cast an unexpected glow over the chic, pale (and frankly sort of sterile) decor, which has always given me the feeling of sharpened corners lurking everywhere. Tonight, bright gore-tex coats and trail shoes trashed by April mud soften the foyer’s pointiness. Much nicer. 

Though I’m late, I dawdle my way through the jumbled footwear, locating a spot to toe off my boots before sliding on my indoor flats. 

This is my favorite part of any celebration: right before I join in. Before the fantasy of sparkling conversations lit by the perfect tipsy buzz turns into the real thing: conversational faux pas that morph into awkward pauses that tumble me down bottomless crevasses of social death. 

_This time will be different_, I tell myself. I’m thirty, ugh; it’s past time I sorted out my socializing phobias. Especially after what happened at work today. Besides, I’m interesting. I have topics of conversation picked out. I know entire scenes of movie banter by heart. How hard can it be to hold a glass of champagne and say something fascinating? 

I pull my shoulders out of their self-defensive hunch and practice a smile that goes up on both sides, like both halves of me are happy to be here. None of the right-side-up, left-side-down smile that makes people ask whether I’m joking or serious. 

“Liz! You’re late.” My sister Amber stomps into the foyer to rummage through the outerwear. She looks beautiful with her streaky blonde hair twisted into a pretty, puffy low bun.

“You’re leaving? It’s barely six.”

“Eleanor’s babysitter bailed. I have to pick her up from aftercare by six-thirty. See you tomorrow night. On time,” she adds, swirling out the door in a gust of April cold.

I’m sure she meant to wish me a happy birthday. She was stressed and distracted and it doesn’t mean anything. Still, a chill wraps around my throat. Amber was my fallback position if other conversations didn’t work out. She’s never much liked having me follow her around, but since we’re sisters, she has to include me when I materialize at her elbow. And since our parents are wintering in Arizona and my best friend is out of town, I was counting on Amber to smooth out any rough spots in my Very Successful Party. 

I’m down to just my husband as a social haven, I guess. 

I hear him before I see him: a golden voice drifting down the stairs, slightly ahead of the golden man himself. Tobin Renner-Lewis is the human version of a cloudless day on a coastal mountain: longish, dark whisky hair still tipped with last summer’s sunshine, Viking cheekbones, rosy winter tan, eyes of glacier blue. His tall, lean-muscled frame speaks to a life spent paddling and mushing and lifting heavy things.

He looks unusually serious, staring at a softcover textbook he’s carrying. Probably one of the business books he reads, but won’t talk about. 

“I don’t know if I’m in one place enough to get this going,” he says, phone to his ear. “But I appreciate the offer. Can I have a couple days to think?” There’s a tempered hope in Tobin’s voice I haven’t heard in a long time. I melt against the wall, eavesdropping harder.

Whatever the other person says prompts a grin with a quirk that hooks my heart. I forgot he had that smile, rueful and real. For a second, I don’t think about how far apart we’ve grown, and only remember the man I fell in love with underneath the summer stars. 

Everything about Tobin changes when he sees me, morphing from something true into something perfect. A photograph of stars, instead of the real thing. 

“DIZZY LIZZIE!” He tucks the book under his elbow and vaults one-handed over the railing, landing softly on the black-and-white-striped rug. A gentle breeze of knockout-level pheromones and cedarwood beard oil wafts across my body. I feel it right through my coat, which I’ll have to return, because this shit was supposed to be windproof. 

“You got my note?” He knocks my toque from my head with his hug. I try to be soft in his arms. Happy the way he wants to feel we are, pretending our hearts have no doors we lock against each other. 

“Yup. I thought the party was at our house,” I say when his grip loosens. Tobin insisted I needed a party. Maybe I agreed because I can’t resist the fantasy of a magical glow-up that makes me belong, like in _13 Going On 30_. Maybe I secretly hoped he’d decorate our house with a “Central Park in spring” theme, after my beloved Nora Ephron romcoms. Then I’d know he saw straight into my heart, and we’d be okay again.

“It was, but my mom thought it made more sense not to carry everything next door.”

“Oh.” 

“Wait till you see the food. And the cake! Mom outdid herself. I’ll put in a day in her garden to pay her back.”

I tamp down a hot flare in my stomach. He could’ve ordered food. And the party didn’t have to be scheduled in the eighteen hours between him finishing one dog sledding trip and starting the next. But he wanted to have a party the day I turn thirty, even if it meant spending one of the few days we have together working for his mom. 

“Let’s go.” He zips me out of my coat. “I invited a couple of the new guides. Couldn’t leave them out, you know?”

“Sure. Wait. Do I look okay?” 

“You look perfect.” He admires me like I’m not the camouflage-colored mate to his bright-feathered goldfinch, my hair and eyes and freckles all the common copper brown of a tarnished penny. 

“Are you sure?” I smooth damp palms over my best black pants. My blouse is builder beige, the ideal color for people to project themselves onto during the successful conversations I will be having tonight.

“You look _perfect_, Diz.” He puts his arm back around me, hollering, “BIRTHDAY BABE’S HEEEEERE!” 

The guests cheer for way less time than I anticipated; I wave half a second after everyone turns back to their conversations. Underneath my high collar, my neck itches. Stress hives already. It’s fine. Amber’s gone, but Tobin will stay with me, and people will come to –

“Tobin. I need you in the kitchen, schatje.” My mother-in-law, Marijke, is looking particularly tall, blonde, and Euro-hot in a white ensemble trimmed with silvery faux fur that matches her current line of designer children’s wear. 

Before I got married, I dreamed of having intimate, huggy relationships with my in-laws. Marijke bakes and sews and looks like Heidi Klum, but huggy, she’s not.
