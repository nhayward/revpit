### Query

For Rebecca Steward, bounty hunting may be a good way to make a living, but it’s an even better way to vengeance. In the 1884 Utah Territory, she spends her days scanning wanted posters and tracking unsuspecting criminals with the belief that they’ll lead her to the outlaw duo who murdered her family ten long years ago. The killers come sauntering back into her life when they rob and flee the town she’s passing through. An inept local sheriff gives chase and before doing so herself, Rebecca reluctantly partners with the sheriff’s son, Jack. He wants to get his father back, while her only concern is her revenge.

When the sheriff is found dead, Jack stays by Rebecca’s side to avoid losing the last constant in his life. Her plan for vengeance begins to alienate Jack as she puts her obsession above everything and everyone, including him. As both the desperation and danger surge, Rebecca is forced to decide how much she’ll sacrifice in her quest for justice against her family’s killers.

WHERE BLOOD RUNS BLACK is a YA historical novel that will appeal to readers of _Vengeance Road_ and _Revenge And The Wild_. It is complete at 73,000 words. This manuscript has also been chosen as a finalist for the agent round in the Fall Fest query contest and as a winner for Twitter’s #RevPit 2019 contest.

### First Five Pages

Loud, drunken laughter echoed out from the saloon and onto the street. I smiled, knowing the man would already be drunk this late in the afternoon. That would certainly make my job easier.

This was the end of the line for Wolfe. I’d been tracking him for weeks and weeks. Now I had him cornered.

I smirked as I eyed one of his wanted posters hanging a few feet away. I stepped around a few people walking past me to get a closer look this newer version. It read June 5th, 1884. Just over a week ago.

They shouldn’t have bothered making up new posters. The ones hanging would be taken down shortly. And not only would Wolfe be locked up, but I’d be a little richer, too.

A few of the outlaw’s most recent crimes were listed below his picture. Everything from robbery to murder, and most carried out with his bare hands. I didn’t pity those who’d had to clean up the crime scenes.

Wolfe himself was the only remarkable thing in this town. Black Creek was nothing more than the same dusty streets and ramshackle, wooden buildings I’d gotten used to seeing while traveling here in the Utah Territory or any of its neighbors. A relentless sun beat down on anyone wandering along Main Street. A few of the low buildings boasted a covered porch, but there wasn’t much other shade to be found. Summers were always difficult to bear anywhere in the territories.

I pushed back the brim of my hat and sauntered toward the saloon’s doors. The black Stetson was worn but fit well. My eyes stayed alert, though I made sure to keep my pace slow and relaxed. I wanted to appear as nothing more than a bystander.

My skirt did a good job hiding both the pistol and knife strapped to my legs. My belt was tightly cinched to accentuate my waist and my plaid shirt was purposely close-fitting as well. If Wolfe was distracted, then he’d be a quick catch. After all, no outlaw ever expected a woman to be the one to bring them to justice.

My brown hair’s length was the one part I didn’t like. It was always kept short for when I needed to disguise myself as a boy, but I preferred my hair longer for a reason as simple as liking the way it framed my face. Now, what little hair I had was pinned up at the nape of my neck.

I pushed the half doors open as I entered the saloon and they creaked as they swung shut behind me. I wrinkled my nose as the sharp smell of alcohol hit me. A few glances were cast my way once I was inside, but the men’s attention quickly returned to their drinks and card games. On another day, I might have joined them for a few rounds of poker.

The saloon itself was poorly lit, even with the afternoon sunlight pouring in from its two large windows. Only a few of the scattered wooden tables and chairs were filled. Most who were in the saloon sat up at the bar and it wasn’t nearly as crowded as it would be later in the day. Besides low conversation, the only sounds were the occasional clinking of glass and a lively melody coming from an out-of-tune piano played by a woman in one of the saloon’s far corners.

I scanned the room and quickly caught sight of Wolfe. A man that large wasn’t able to hide. His size and strength were his advantages, but also what I needed to be wary of.

The bartender traded me a glass of whiskey for a few small silver coins. I allowed myself an occasional glance at Wolfe while sipping my drink. No matter how much I drank, I hated the taste of the stuff. But it was strong and some days I needed that, never mind how much the whiskey burned when I downed it.

The dark beard Wolfe had grown was short but thick. He was so big that the leather boots and clothes he wore had to have been made for him. A single pistol was holstered at his side, but I didn’t see any other weapons on him. Wolfe’s bounty was a large one. I would be able to feed myself for a while.

I leaned against the bar counter and glanced toward the outlaw again. I locked eyes with Wolfe this time and walked over when he didn’t look away. The cruel gleam he held in his eyes made me more nervous. I steeled myself. This was not the first outlaw I had brought in. He would certainly not be the last.

Wolfe nodded at the glass in my hand. “You here drinking all alone, sweetheart?”

I almost frowned at him, but then remembered the role I was trying to play.

“Not anymore,” I said.

“Don’t worry. There’s plenty of us gentlemen here to keep you company, me included.”

I observed the saloon before me. The outlaw was right about the majority of the saloon’s current patrons. A barmaid in a corset and short dress sat over near a poker game, but she was the only other woman in sight besides the piano player. The ladies of the night wouldn’t be here looking for their next customers for another few hours.

Wolfe leaned in close. “I’d be worried about a lady like you. Places like this are dangerous, especially if you’re drunk.”

I gave him a sweet smile. It sickened me to do so, but he was falling right into my trap. Wolfe was known for being a womanizer. It had been too easy to lay the bait for him.

I drank again from my whiskey glass, the cool liquid a relief amidst the day’s heat. “And what about you? Are you dangerous?”

Wolfe’s eyes sparked at the question, but he never answered me. “Where are you from?” he said instead.

I gestured with my drink. “Wherever I find work.”

He shot me a sideways glance. “And what sort of work?”

“Whatever work I can find.”

Wolfe rested an arm on the wooden counter. “Got it. Not much for jawing, huh? Me neither.”

“There’s better things to do than sit around discussing nothing.”

“And does the sweet little thing have a name?”

I almost bared my teeth. I was not a sweet little thing. The pistol strapped to my leg was  evidence of that.

“Do you have a name?” I said.

“No-name basis then. Girl, I know what you want, but why do you want it from me?”
 
I downed the rest of the whiskey and placed the glass on the counter behind me. The bartender tried to refill it, but I waved him off. Any more alcohol and I wouldn’t be sharp enough to deal with Wolfe.

The outlaw was completely relaxed, thinking me nothing more than his newest prize or conquest. It was the perfect time to strike. I didn’t have the patience to deal with him much longer, anyway.
 
I reached down under the guise of adjusting my boot and rose again with my pistol in hand. I seized Wolfe’s wrist and twisted his arm back before pointing my pistol at him. My grip on his arm was kept tight. I expected him to try to overpower me at any moment.

“You’re gonna step outside with me,” I said. “Try anything and you’ll be dead.”

Wolfe peered down at the gun pointed at his side and realized what I already knew. I’d shoot him dead if he attempted to draw his own weapon.

“I don’t have any money with me,” he said. “You’d be better off stealing from someone else.”

I nodded my head to the door. “The only money I want is your bounty. Let’s go.”

Wolfe stared at me. “Not a pretty little girl, after all. You’re a pretty little snake.”

I cocked my pistol and repeated, “Let’s go.”

The outlaw didn’t protest this time and did as I ordered. We garnered quite a few looks as we exited the saloon, especially since it was a woman who had her gun to the man’s back. A couple of men stood and took a few steps from their table at the back of the saloon. I forced Wolfe through the pair of half doors and made a show of waving my pistol around before the pair could do anything stupid. They opted not to follow and returned to their seats.

“Damn that man,” I said as I saw the empty saloon front. I had told the local sheriff I would deliver Wolfe to him for arrest if he waited outside for me. I hadn’t expected him to doubt me. Well, that sheriff was about to be proven wrong.

All it took was my moment of distraction for Wolfe to wrench his arm from my grasp. I pulled the trigger on my pistol and the kickback tugged at my hand. Wolfe had already stepped outside my aim and so the shot missed. The echo of the shot rang in my ears, but I had long since grown used to the sound.

The outlaw had his own gun drawn and cocked before I could fire again.

“Stay,” Wolfe bellowed as he backed into the street. He kept his gun aimed at me.

“Stop him,” I yelled before he could run.

Despite my yells, no one stepped in to help. I was disappointed, but not surprised when everyone cleared the street instead. They were desperate to get out of the way. One man in a suit coat and pressed pants didn’t even stop to grab the bowler hat that had flown off his head as he ran. Wolfe’s size and blazing eyes made even me hesitate. But I had spent too many weeks tracking him to let him escape now.
