### Query

Sixteen-year-old reporter Leona Swick has a knack for exposing corruption in her high school newspaper. The author of a popular investigative column, she dreams of becoming an award-winning journalist like her dad. Yet, no matter how many stories Leona inks, she can’t forget the one she missed—the story that could have saved her father’s life. Leona never bought the theory that her father was killed in a robbery gone-wrong and believes there’s more to the story.

After winning a spot in an elite summer journalism program, Leona is determined to prove herself by taking home first prize, a much-needed college scholarship and the coveted title of top high school journalist. But when a seasoned reporter reveals that her father’s killer could be released from prison after new questions arise about the case, her top priority turns personal—the truth about her dad’s death. 

Leona decides to use camp assignments as cover to re-trace her dad’s final footsteps and uncover the real motive behind his murder. Armed with clues in her father’s journal, she teams up with her infuriating (but very dateable) arch-rival, Theo, to investigate. Each interview and clue uncovered puts her more at risk of being caught, tossed out of the program, and losing her shot at the scholarship. But the more Leona learns, the more she believes that the murderer killed her father in a last-ditch attempt to silence an untold story he was working on. 

As the investigation heats up, one fact becomes clear. If Leona can’t uncover her father’s final story, she may become the killer’s next headline.

Complete at 89,000 words, PAPER GIRL is a YA mystery and 2020 RevPit winner that combines the snark and badassery of _Veronica Mars_ with the closed-case investigative twists of _A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder_. 

I'm a former journalist and worked for eleven years at a top Boston public relations firm before joining Simmons University as its director of media relations. I earned an MFA in creative writing from Emerson College, and my work has been featured in _Embark Literary Journal_.

### First Five Pages

Chapter 1

My dad used to say that a good reporter is like a gardener. Always digging up dirt. 

Unfortunately, that dirt has me trapped in the principal’s office on the final day of sophomore year when I should be home packing for the best summer of my life. 

I sit across from Principal Wharton—or Wart, as we call him—while he aims his droopy, bulldog-style frown at me. He jabs the final edition of the _Gabbington Stool_ with his middle finger. It’s the finger with the mole, the one that earned him his nickname. He slides our school newspaper across the desk. Beside him, Mr. Bronson, our gym teacher, shoots daggers my way. A Channel 4 Southern Massachusetts news truck is visible through the window behind him. 

Wart lifts the paper from the desk. “‘Gabbington’s Great White Males.’” He reads my headline and lets the page fall. “What exactly is a great white male?”

His rhetorical question doesn’t require an answer, but Wart is the ultimate Great White Male. I’m still furious he’s more outraged by my story than the actions of the five-member, all men Gabbington High scholarship committee. 

“Divine inspiration from English class,” I explain. “I wasn’t a huge fan of _Moby Dick_, but I appreciate catchy headlines.”

Angry splotches color Mr. Bronson’s cheeks. “Leona deserves to be kicked off the paper and suspended.”

Wart narrows his eyes at me and adjusts his tie. “You’ve gone too far this time.” 

I lean back in my chair. Normally I wouldn’t be too worried about Wart. This isn’t my first, second, or even third visit to his office. My column, “Leona’s Lit”—as in on fire—draws his ire at least once a semester. Earlier today, Wart charged through classrooms like a velociraptor, confiscating copies of the _Gabbington Stool_—because of my story. 

“I want to know how you acquired those college scholarship applications,” Mr. Bronson demands. “The reviews are confidential, shared only among the committee.”

Journalism rule number one. Never rat out a source. And definitely not in this case, since the source is my best friend—Mia Lively, hacker extraordinaire. 

I lift my chin. “People reached out because they were concerned about an injustice.” 

“Injustice? I’ll give you an injustice.” Mr. Bronson clutches the whistle he uses to torture us with bleacher sprints. “That article was slanderous.” He pauses. “Must run in the family.” 

Though he mutters the last line, I bristle. “You mean _libelous_. But it’s not. Everything I wrote is true. The scholarship committee is biased against female and minority students.”

Mr. Bronson snatches the paper from Wart’s desk. He ignores the black and white photos of the Gabbington High patriarchy and begins reading. “‘When Maggie Hendrix kissed a girl behind the bleachers during gym class, she had no idea it would cost her $20,000. Being a lesbian isn’t a crime, but James Bronson and the Gabbington Public High School Scholarship Committee sure treated it that way. And she’s not alone.’” 

I cover my mouth to hide a grin. One of my better lead paragraphs, if I do say so myself. Since Wart is more likely to morph into a feminist than high school kids are to read anything longer than a text, perfecting a juicy tweet-length opening is essential.

Wart eyes Mr. Bronson, who looks as though he wants to wring my neck. “We don’t need to reread the column. Once was more than enough.” He turns to me. “Just so you know, the winning senior deserved your dad’s scholarship as much as anyone.”

Please. The kid’s best story was a three-hundred-word article ranking new video game releases. Definitely not worthy of a scholarship for committed journalists heading to college.

“The student has been interning at a local news station all spring,” Wart says, after seeing my skeptical expression. “You missed that crucial tidbit during your journalistic witch-hunt.” 

I shift in my seat. I didn’t know that. Missing part of a story is like overlooking a piece of broken glass. Often it comes back to cut you.

“Leona’s column has been nothing but trouble,” Mr. Bronson chimes in, as if sensing an opening. “How many times over the past two years has this school been forced to deal with something she wrote?”

“You could always submit a letter to the editor,” I suggest. “The _Gabbington Stool_ loves hearing from its loyal readers.”

“This is exactly what I’m talking about,” Mr. Bronson says. “She has no respect for anyone. I’ve talked to her other teachers, even they say—”

“Please, James,” Wart says. “That’s enough.” 

I keep my expression calm, but inside I’m fuming. He’s been talking about me to other teachers? Definitely not cool. Before I can defend myself, the bell rings. We stare at each other. 

“I take it I’m not free to go?” I joke, trying to lighten the mood. 

Wart’s frown deepens, but Mr. Bronson rises. “I have to leave.”

Wart nods and looks relieved. “I’ll take it from here.”

Mr. Bronson exits, leaving a wall of silence behind. Wart is the first to break it.

“Why did you write that column?” he asks. 

“Because it’s a good story!” I _love_ journalism. More specifically, investigative journalism. Some kids ride rollercoasters or watch horror movies for an adrenaline rush. I break news and expose corruption, just like my dad did. A spidery sensation tingles the back of my neck whenever I close in on a secret thread that unlocks a story—like a detective cracking a case.

In this case that tingling feeling careened into overdrive when the scholarship committee awarded the Ryan J. Swick Memorial Scholarship—which Mom and a local journalism nonprofit founded five years ago in honor of Dad—to a lazy-ass senior. Once I started investigating, I discovered the committee’s behavior was part of a larger pattern. Eighty percent of Gabbington High scholarships awarded over the past five years went to boys, a fact I noted in my story. 

“I need to know who gave you those application reviews,” Wart says. 

“I can’t tell you that. It would be unethical.”

“This isn’t a newsroom, or an episode of _Media Mayhem_, it’s a school,” he snaps. 

I stiffen. Wart has a lot of nerve mentioning that show after the way it portrayed my dad.

“Do you realize how much trouble you’ve caused?” Wart points a finger at the window. A reporter in high heels clutches a microphone under the awning, camera rolling. “The story is trending. Our scholarship committee could be _sued_.” 

I suppose he has a point. When I wrote and tweeted my column, I had no idea actual TV networks would camp out at our school. I just wanted the scholarship committee to admit its mistake. “I didn’t mean for this to happen.” 

“I think you _did_ mean for this to happen,” he argues. “You wanted to make a splash and embarrass this school.”

I open my mouth to argue, but then I shut it. Life is a giant wheel of randomness. The robber who shot and killed Dad could have picked a million people, but the wheel stopped spinning and he attacked my full-of-life father. Nothing is crueler than bad luck. “This scholarship is all we have left to honor my dad,” I remind Wart. “He deserved better.”

Wart’s expression softens. “No story is going to bring your father back.”

My grip tightens on the chair. I don’t want his pity. “No, but my stories can expose wrongdoing.”

Wart flushes a shade of purple that matches the violet-flower watercolor painting behind his desk. “The scholarship committee may need additional oversight,” he concedes, “but Mr. Bronson is right about the column. I’m terminating it. You’re off the paper.”

My mouth drops open. “You’re censoring me?”  

“You’re a talented writer, but not every article should be written. Stories have consequences.”

His words sound remarkably like _Media Mayhem’s_ criticism of Dad. “But I—” 

Wart raises a hand. “That’s enough. No more arguing, unless you want me to call _So You Think You Can Write_ and suggest that they rethink your place in the camp.”

My insides twist as Wart’s warning hits the mark. The eight-week camp is my ticket out of Gabbington this summer and the chance to claim the title of Massachusetts’ top high school reporter. I have no idea if Wart would really sabotage my spot, but no way will I risk finding out. 

I wrack my brain for an appropriate response to Wart’s threat, when a knock interrupts my thoughts. A woman with fiery red hair a shade darker than my own strides into the room. 

“You called Mom?” I ask. This is serious. Especially since she took time off work to come here. Normally she’d send Grandma Donna. I adjust my t-shirt to make sure my tattoo is covered. Mom doesn’t know about my sixteenth birthday present to myself. 

Mom shoots me one of her patented scowls and turns to Wart. “Sorry, I’m late.”
