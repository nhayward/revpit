### Query

I’m excited to submit WREN AND THE SCARECROW, a spooky middle grade fantasy complete at 50,000 words. Combining the dark, whimsical tone of Heather Kassner’s _The Forest of Stars_ with the twisted loyalty of Hanna Alkaf’s _The Girl and the Ghost_, WREN AND THE SCARECROW explores themes of grief and loss when a young girl’s loneliness accidentally brings the village scarecrow to life.
 
Born with a mysterious birthmark, twelve-year-old Wren sticks to the shadows to hide from the superstitious villagers who believe she’s cursed. But after a sickness kills her mother and leaves her father weak and helpless, Wren has no one left to hide behind. Despite the violent legends that surround him, Wren turns to the village scarecrow, who she’s often felt is her only friend. Overflowing with grief and loneliness, Wren’s tears bring the scarecrow to life. Though she must hide his existence from a village who fears the legends are true, Wren trusts the loyal scarecrow and is grateful for his companionship…until it turns into jealousy. 
 
The villagers reach out to support Wren as she nurses her ailing father, making her question her curse. When Wren starts to step out of the shadows to let the others in, the scarecrow becomes possessive. What starts as small misunderstandings evolve into hurtful pranks as the scarecrow takes his jealousy out on the villagers. When his actions begin to endanger Wren’s new friends and her Papa’s recovery, Wren must find help to stop the scarecrow before he becomes too strong. If she can’t learn to be vulnerable and accept the help of others, she risks losing herself to the shadows for good.
 
I’m an active member of multiple critique groups, and write picture books, middle grade, and young adult novels. I grew up in central Illinois surrounded by cornfields decidedly free of both scarecrows and curses. When not writing or working as a school social worker, I can usually be found seeking adventure with my family just outside of Chicago.

### First Five Pages

**Chapter One**

No one in the village was sure where the sickness came from.

There was talk of course. There’s always talk. Some said it was a curse from the Witch in the Woods. Widow MacAbey swore it was a punishment for the village’s leniency to heretics. Others said it came from the darkness, from the shadows. But Wren knew what they really thought—the sickness came because of _her_. 

Mama said it was nonsense. She said the sickness came because the water at the bottom of the village well went bad. Mama always boiled their water. She told others to boil theirs too. But not everyone listened.

And when neighbors brought stew to your table to share, you didn’t ask if they’d made sure to wash their vegetables in boiled water or cooked their rabbit meat before it went green. You said _thank you_ and you sat down and broke bread in fellowship.

And then, everyone got sick.

Mama died from it. 

Papa probably wished he had.

\#

Widow MacAbey once publicly wondered whether Wren had a heart. She did when the widow had said it. But not after Mama died.

After Mama died, Wren’s heart broke into a hundred million pieces. She felt it break in her chest and she heard the shatter as the pieces landed on the floor. It was the only thing she could hear. 

When the Great Wind swept through to gather Mama’s spirit, it blew all the scattered, broken pieces of Wren’s heart away with it. The room spun and shrank, closing in on her like a surging shadow and threatening to crack her ribs and crush the air from her lungs.

So, Wren ran.

She ran past Mama’s crumpled wool sweater on the kitchen table, past the boots Papa hadn’t worn for days, and past the cold bowls of broth that neither Mama nor Papa had been able to drink. She ran through the front door that had protected her for so long and down the worn dirt path, sharp stones biting the soles of her bare feet. Past the low, wood-beam fence that let others know the border of her family’s land, so they’d know not to hunt. So Wren’s family would be safe.

She ran fast and so far, that all she could feel was the wild rush of her blood and the sharp burn in her chest and the thick ache in her muscles. When she couldn’t run anymore, she collapsed. Her head throbbed. Her nose and ears stung with cold, even as sweat gathered on her forehead. 

Slowly, she became aware of the damp earth beneath her palms. Of the wet dew soaking through the knees of her cotton dress. The dirt, sticking to the blue cornflowers dotting the fabric, and the discarded corn husks whispering in the wind. The grasshoppers strumming their nightly patrols, hiding from the keen-eyed owls swooping above.  

Even in the dark, she knew exactly where she was.

The scarecrow loomed above her, his straw hair sticking wildly out of his floppy hat. A coarse green shirt covered his lumpy arms which were stretched open, welcoming. She couldn’t see his face, but she knew the short, tight stitches of his mouth attempted to greet her with a lopsided grin. 

It made sense, really. Wren sometimes joked that the scarecrow was her best friend. Her only friend. She and the scarecrow had something in common. 

Everyone was afraid of them.

Wren, because of the wine-red birthmark spilled across her face and the curse Widow MacAbey claimed came with it. The scarecrow, because of the legends that said he would come to life with a rage, seeking vengeance.

But he’d always been there when Wren needed him most. He never ran away or whispered. The scarecrow knew all her secrets, and wishes, and hopes. He didn’t laugh at them, or judge her, or think her silly. There was no vengeance, only a steady, supportive ear. 

So, when Wren’s world ended, it made sense that her feet brought her here. That she spilled the tears and shattered pieces of her heart in the dirt below him. 

An accidental sacrifice.

She didn’t bother telling him what brought her there. She wasn’t ready to say the words aloud. Didn’t want them to be true. She couldn’t bear to utter them in that lonely, empty place. 

She only wished she weren’t so alone. 

The wind stirred and the breeze crept through the scarecrow’s hair, his shoulders shifting gently in a sorrowful slump. Maybe he already knew. Maybe that was enough. 

Maybe it had to be. 

**Chapter Two**

The good thing about losing your heart is that you don’t feel things as much. Or as deep. 

So, Wren wasn’t as sad about Papa’s sickness after Mama died. There was just nowhere left to feel the sadness. Which was good because there was a lot of work to do. And sadness can weigh on a person, make it hard to move or breathe.

But, when your heart’s gone, you can still move. Like one of the marionette puppets from the traveling fair. The movements are unsteady, have a jerk to them. But they’re movements all the same. 

The next morning, when Wren told Papa about Mama, it felt like someone else was saying the words. Someone else pulling the strings. Wren was just saying the lines, off stage. Papa was still so feverish, though, and Wren couldn’t be sure if he’d heard. If he’d understood.

That made it easier, too.

The cottage had been quiet since Mama and Papa got sick but, after Mama died, the silence was deafening. The large single room of the house was absent of Mama’s laughter and songs. Empty of Papa’s stories and tools. It felt hollow, like the cottage had lost its heart, too. The yellow paint of the windowsills looked sickly, nothing like the sunflowers for which Wren and Papa had painted them on her sixth birthday. Papa’s favorite adventure stories sat stacked by his bed, untouched. Wren wondered how long it would be before they gathered dust. It wasn’t a problem they’d ever had before. 

Wren kept busy to avoid looking at the loneliness tucking itself into the corners of the room, hiding behind the shadows. She gathered eggs from the henhouse and milked the goat and swept the dust. She brought in wood from the pile and counted the days before she would have to chop more wood (three), something Papa had not yet taught her to do. He’d wanted to protect her from the hard jobs, he’d said. He’d taught her how to fix and mend but not how to swing an axe or split a log. 

What happened when there was no one else to do the hard jobs? 

After taking stock of their onions (four) and garlic (two), Wren made broth the way Mama had taught her, but it held no flavor. She added salt until she ruined it. Not that it mattered, Papa wasn’t awake long enough for more than a few sips and, even then, it mostly dribbled down his chin. And Wren certainly had no appetite. Her stomach growled in protest but they both knew she wouldn’t be able to keep anything down. 

Wren’s body jerked on as the marionette strings led her through one small job after the next, each one more meaningless than the last. She was going through the motions of life but Papa was unable to move. She was a girl with no heart. And Mama was gone. The strings were all that kept her moving.

At midday, the silence was interrupted by a knock on the door. 

The sound rapped against Wren’s skull, shattering the quiet of the house and reminding her of the outside world. Squeezing her eyes tight, she hoped they’d go away. 

_Knock. Knock. Knock._

Papa mumbled—a worried kind of mumble that made Wren’s eyebrows knit together. His only sounds were ones of discomfort but his fever had come down. If the knocking continued, it could interrupt his rest, stall his already painfully slow recovery. There was no one else to shoo the intruder away. Papa had always done the protecting but now there was no one to protect him. No one except Wren. 

Squaring her shoulders, Wren swung open the door, keeping her eyes trained on the smooth, worn dirt on the other side of the threshold. A pair of women’s worn leather boots stood. Waiting. 

“Wren?” Rachel’s voice was kind but sad, and Wren lifted her eyes. Threads of silver wove through a thick, dark braid and golden eyes set in a smooth, brown face looked back. Really looked. 

It was almost enough to thaw the ice that had crept into Wren’s chest, but she shifted her eyes and buried the feeling down.
