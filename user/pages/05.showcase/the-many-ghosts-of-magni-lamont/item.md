### Query

I chose to submit to you because your MSWL says you’re interested in a YA paranormal novel with heartbreaking themes.

Magni Lamont is a teen witch who can see ghosts. When her crush asks for help because she’s being haunted, Magni offers her gift to figure out why. Magni’s twin sister—once her closest confidant and best friend—distances herself as Magni and her crush grow closer. But as Magni’s investigation unearths one devastating secret after another, the entity becomes more aggressive.

If Magni can’t figure out what happened, her crush could pay the price of the spirit’s mysterious desire for vengeance. Magni and her sister are forced to confront their own ghosts to protect each other and save the ones they love.

THE MANY GHOSTS OF MAGNI LAMONT is a 95,000-word queer YA paranormal mystery novel that explores themes of grief, legacy, and family. Mixing magic with the mundane, this story is great for fans of Maggie Stiefvater and Zoraida Córdova. Consider it Isabel Stirling’s _These Witches Don’t Burn_ meets Karen M. McManus’s _One of Us is Lying_.

This book is my fourth completed novel and the first to be queried for traditional publishing. My first novel, _The Star and the Ocean_, was named one of 50 winners in the Watty Awards out of over 280,000 entries worldwide in 2017. To date, the book and its sequels have amassed over half a million reads collectively. I am also a graduate of The Writer’s Studio, a creative writing program offered through Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C., where I focused my studies on YA/genre fiction.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Maggie Derrick

There was a dead man in the parking lot, and the only person who could see him was Magni Lamont.

She wasn’t afraid of him, though the way cars kept driving over the spot where he stood was more than a little creepy. Magni watched each one turn from the main road and trundle into the busy mall lot. She wondered if they noticed an icy chill when their sedans and SUVs passed through him.

Chip Fletcher had been haunting the mall parking lot since dying there three years earlier. In life, Chip had been a drifter—a man with an intellectual disability who was left to his own devices—known in this part of town as the guy who spent his days pushing traffic cones through the streets in a pilfered shopping cart. Chip’s body was discovered one frosty, late-November morning. The victim of a hit-and-run, his broken body had been left to freeze to the asphalt next to his overturned cart. His dirty orange traffic cones had spilled out around him, as though he had done everyone the courtesy of marking his own crime scene.

At least, that was what the small-town rumor mill said for the day or two anyone said anything about it. Chip was buried and forgotten before the week was done.

Forgotten, it seemed, by everyone except Magni, who didn’t have much choice in the matter. That was the way of things when you were a teenage witch who could see ghosts—they wouldn’t let you forget.

Magni watched Chip shuffle in place through the windows of the coffee shop that shared a wall with the bookstore where she had just finished her shift. After a summer of working in the bookstore, Magni had mostly grown desensitized to the feeling of his unblinking eyes on her when she passed by the windows. Besides, he was harmless—even if the relentless staring was kind of rude.

Still, as Magni reclined against the coffee bar, her mind wandering idly while she waited for her drink, and for her sister, her hand instinctively went to the crystal amulet hanging around her neck. Her fingers grazed the gem’s smooth facets, and at once, she felt soothed and safe, which was exactly what a powerful protective charm was supposed to do.

“Is it Fletch?”

Magni jumped. She glanced back to the bar, across which her twin sister, Amethyst—or, as she preferred to be called, Thyst—leaned. Thyst craned her neck, trying to get a better view of what Magni was staring at.

“Yeah, he’s doing that marching-in-place thing again.”

“Poor bastard,” Thyst said. Her short, undercut bob was pulled back into the tiniest stub of a ponytail that jutted out of the back of her head. A chunk of her asymmetrical bangs came loose as she slid back to her feet with a shake of her head. She picked up a takeaway cup and pushed it across the bar. “Here’s your tea latte. Sorry, I’m going to be a few more minutes. Wednesday’s running late for her shift.”

A tiny thrill fluttered in the pit of Magni’s stomach. “That’s okay, I don’t mind waiting.”

Thyst gave her sister a knowing look. “Oh, I’m sure you don’t.”

Heat flooded Magni’s cheeks. “Shut up, Thyst.”

Snickering, Thyst hurried away to serve the crowd of customers who had just walked in. Magni took her drink and slinked away, her cheeks still burning from embarrassment. The thing about being a twin was that it was much harder to keep secrets from each other than it was to keep secrets from everybody else. Despite Magni having never said a word, Thyst somehow knew she’d been quietly nursing a crush on her coworker Wednesday for the entire summer.

At least, that’s how Magni assumed she’d put it together. There was always a chance she had found out through scrying, or maybe the cards had told her. Thyst had a penchant for divination. But however Thyst had figured it out, Magni desperately hoped it hadn’t been because she was obvious about it, because that would be mortifying.

If Magni _had_ been making a fool of herself around Wednesday, there was no way she could have helped herself. It wasn’t her fault that Wednesday was so warm and inviting—the type of person who had a way of making anyone she talked to, including someone as shy as Magni, feel like the most important person in the room. So what if she hung on every word Wednesday said? When a person was as passionate as Wednesday was about her love of cinema and filmmaking and life in general, it was hard not to listen.

When she was sure her sister wasn’t looking, Magni shrugged out of her unflattering blue work vest and combed her fingers through her long ponytail. Not that she was preening or anything.

“Greetings, witches!”

Magni jumped, surprised out of her thoughts for the second time that afternoon. Latte sloshed from the mouth of her cup lid and seeped down to pool around her fingers.

“Oh, shoot! I’m sorry, Magni,” Wednesday said with a wince as she circled around from behind Magni’s chair, looking sheepish. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

Wednesday leaned forward and smiled, and for a split second, Magni was dazzled. She loved the way Wednesday’s entire face lit up when she smiled, the way her tawny complexion seemed to glow. When Wednesday’s dark, glossy hair slid out from where it had been tucked behind her ear, Magni felt a powerful urge to reach out and guide it back into place. But there was latte on her fingertips, and, even if there wasn’t, Magni was _not_ that bold.

“That’s okay,” Magni said, forcing a laugh. She transferred the cup to her other hand and shook the latte off. “It’s fine.”

“Wednesday!” Thyst shouted from the coffee bar as she handed her last two customers their orders, her brow furrowed with irritation. “Where have you been? Your shift started fifteen minutes ago.”

“I know, I’m sorry.” Wednesday hurried around the counter, pulling her backpack off as she went. “Lora and I were doing some filming down by the river and I completely lost track of time.”

Thyst rolled her eyes and untied her apron. She tossed it to Wednesday before stalking into the back room. “You owe me.”

“Sure.” She pulled the canvas apron over her head and turned her attention to Magni. “Did Thyst say anything about the Ruckus?”

Magni blinked over her cup. She knew about the Ruckus—the legendary bush party Willowby High School students held on the last Sunday of summer every year. It wasn’t really Magni’s scene. “What about it?”

“Thyst said she’s going this year and she mentioned you might wanna come too?” A sparkle in her umber eyes said she was going and she was excited about it. “What do you think?”

_Thyst said what now?_

“Oh.” She dropped her gaze to the cup clasped between her hands and tried to act like she wasn’t surprised. “I don’t know. I haven’t really thought about it.” Magni had never been one for parties—she simply didn’t understand the appeal. Still, she didn’t want to admit that getting drunk in the woods with a bunch of rowdy teenagers didn’t sound like her idea of a good time when it clearly was to Wednesday.

“Well, I think you should come,” Wednesday said. “It’s such a blast. I mean, it might be a bit different this year—usually my brother helps pull it together, but his band’s got a gig _and_ he’s moving into his new apartment in the city that weekend, so he won’t be able to make it.”

Magni smiled. She didn’t know Wednesday’s brother or his band, and she wasn’t sure what to say next.

Luckily, Wednesday didn’t seem to have the same problem when it came to holding a conversation.

“I mean, he _could_ come. I’m actually going up to help him with the move—y’know, grunt work in exchange for getting me into the bar where the band is playing so I can get some footage.” She paused, and Magni watched her face soften in a thoughtful gaze. “Well, and so I can party, too, I guess. But I’m coming back early to be at the Ruckus.”

“Okay, we get it,” Thyst said, rounding the counter and joining them at the bar. She motioned for Wednesday to hand her a cup she’d left waiting on the other side. “The Ruckus is worth bailing on orientation week parties for. Don’t worry, we’ll be there.”

Magni looked up, bewildered—she certainly hadn’t committed to anything. But she said nothing.

“Awesome! Well, if I don’t see you before then, enjoy the last few days of your summer, Magni.” Wednesday pointed at Thyst. “And I’ll see you tomorrow. Thanks for holding down the fort for me.”

“Cover an extra break for me and I might consider us even. Later.”
