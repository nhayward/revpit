### Query

Impulsive Kalki Kamal has played many parts in her short life: beloved daughter, treasured lover, worried wife, and head of an all-female terrorist cell, though she prefers the term “freedom fighters.” After helping end British Occupation in 2011, she accepted the role of Commissioner of Mumbai. Now she has her sights set on becoming the next Prime Minister of India. 

But her political opponents are hard at work, destroying her reputation and her chances of winning election. In a bid for humanization, Kalki agrees to a series of interviews about growing up a rebel in colonized India. As the interviews gain popularity, she delves deeper into recollections that make her question her own actions, her hatred of her British adversary, and her decision to keep her relationship secret.

Revealing to the public that she loved another woman would topple her whole campaign, and if Kalki’s rivals took office, they would push the country into a disastrous new war. When memories from the Occupation force her to confront what freedoms she really fought for, Kalki must decide if repression and silence will be the price she pays for ambition. 

Moving between Kalki's past during Occupation and her present, THE TEN INCARNATIONS OF REBELLION is an #ownvoices 93,000-word adult alternate history featuring an LGBTQ+ Indian protagonist. It shares themes of female power and revolution with _The Rebel Queen_ and elements of setting with _Before We Visit the Goddess_.

I am part of the Indian diaspora, and members of my family fought and died in the Indian independence movement. I work as an educator in Chicago, where I try to develop a love of reading in my students.

##### Interview no. 1

##### _Matsya_, Fish

_Did you know I once murdered a man with my bare hands?_ I want to ask the rudest reporter in Mumbai. Of course, if I actually said that, my Communications Manager would attempt to murder me with his bare hands, and I am no longer in the fighting shape of a wanted terrorist. 

The reporter stares at me in silence, slightly dwarfed by her fashionably oversized dress. Adhering to current styles may be required for her job, but it amuses me to pretend this annoying crusader is simply shallow. As I wait for her to reveal her hand first, I wonder if she senses the decades of history in this room and understands that it would still be a British stronghold were it not for freedom fighters like me. 

“This is unethical!” she exclaims, the words tumbling out of her without warning. 

Of all the things she might think of the arrangement, this is an unanticipated charge. “Unethical?”

She glares at me across the wide expanse of wooden desk between us, one of the only things the British left in City Hall when they fled. I keep it as a reminder of our victory. “I know why you’ve brought me here.” 

“Ms. Gupta, you came of your own free will. I did not bring you anywhere.” My tone stays mild and level. _Aai_ would be proud.

“It’s that article I wrote about your new ocean cleanup policy last week,” she barrels on. Her short frame shifts, and I imagine her feet straining to reach the ground from her tall cushioned chair.

“Yes, that’s right.” It has nothing to do with ethics. I do hope she’s wondering if the phrase, ‘the pig-headed Commissioner will soon have a body to match as she bloats up on profit while her city starves’ may have gone too far, now that she’s sitting across from the pig herself.

Her hands have steadied, folded on top of her beaded Indian handbag. I’m tempted to point out the irony in her hatred of protectionist policies that keep such local industries afloat, but that will anger her further. “I don’t care what threats you make. I won’t stop writing about what I see. If you silence me, someone else will take my place.”

I squash the urge to roll my eyes at her melodrama. “I believe there has been a misunderstanding. You are here because we are offering you an exclusive interview on my maritime policy.” I leave out the fact that we are hoping to lower the level of sheer vitriol spewing from her employer’s news outlet week after week.

Ms. Gupta gapes at me, apparently shocked silent by the proposal. If only she stayed so quiet when confronted with my policies. After her hit piece on my proposal for environmental regulations, my team briefed me on Sanika Gupta. At 27, she is the youngest senior reporter in her network and is maneuvering for a permanent on-air position. Her vicious articles earn her air time. She is also the most dangerous type of adversary: she truly believes that open markets, deregulation, and military might will secure a better life for every Indian. Ms. Gupta wields her righteousness like a scythe, cutting through any momentum I try to build for my new campaign, and my appearances on friendlier outlets have proven ineffective in combating her destruction.

Now she appears frozen. “We can reschedule if you need time to prepare,” I offer. 

“No!” she shouts. “Sorry, no. Just give me a moment.” She digs through her bag, then looks up. “May I record this conversation?”

I incline my head. She places her phone on the desk, sets it to airplane mode, and opens a recording file, making sure I can clearly see each action.

The technological progress that has occurred since our nation won independence never ceases to astound me. We had cell phones, but having recording technology and unfettered internet access at our fingertips was unthinkable just ten years ago.

In another minute, she is ready to begin. She taps the start button on her phone and says clearly, “Sanika Gupta, interviewing Commissioner Kalki Kamal. Mumbai City Hall. January 7th, 2017. Alright, Commissioner, many would argue that your new anti-dumping policies regarding the Bay are having serious negative effects on Mumbai’s manufacturing industry, which you have championed in the past. Why the sudden pivot?”

I have practiced this answer with Mr. Veerlapati several times. “In the five years since we gained independence, my office focused almost exclusively on job creation and education, to help people through the difficult economic transition. Now we are reaching a point of stability and can put resources towards other issues of importance without compromising our core work. In this case, cleaning our environment.”  

Ms. Gupta leans forward, dark eyes blazing. “Except it is compromising your core work. It’s hard to generate profits and create new jobs when there are so many regulations.”

“How do you know that? Have you spoken to these companies?” I ask her. She presses her lips together, shakes her head, and doesn’t meet my eyes. “My office met with several leading Mumbai manufacturers to discuss our environmental policies, and they did not express serious worries that these policies would hinder job growth.”

She purses her lips. “This policy lines the city’s treasury with fines and fees. It benefits City Hall, not the people of Mumbai. People are asking for better parks and recreation facilities, not for the ability to swim in the ocean.”

“That’s because swimming in the ocean isn’t an option right now,” I counter. “If it were possible, I think you would find interest. And funds raised from environment-related payments are partially earmarked for the development of community centers.”

“What evidence do you have that people would swim in the ocean if possible?” she asks.

It is time to start steering her towards our destination. “Because I did it not so long ago, during Occupation. You know, not everything the British did was bad.” 

Her eyes convey more surprise than when I told her this was an interview. “What, there were Britishers that you liked?” she asks, sarcasm lacing her voice.

“There were a few,” I respond. “Some fought for our independence, and I liked and admired them. But I was referring, in fact, to British policy. While it’s not a drop in the bucket compared to the evils they wrought in this country, they kept our ocean clean for centuries. When I think of my childhood, I think of the sea. I want Mumbai’s children, the first children born in freedom, to have this privilege too.”

“I thought the sea was off limits back then.”

This is exactly where I wanted us to end up – a story chosen to raise sympathy for the ocean itself. Even Ms. Gupta may find it difficult to rail against regulating our waters after this. “You are correct. But no British decree could make the sea any less ours. Sometimes, the ocean even aided our rebellion. We owe it.”

“Ah, it was a source of inspiration,” Ms. Gupta says, sounding almost bored.

“The ocean physically helped us.” I hide a smile as her disinterest melts into confusion.

Before she can respond, I say, “I think it would make more sense if I told you about my first time going to the sea.” Ms. Gupta nods, and I cast my mind back to 1986.

I learned how to defy at age five. Although I did not know it, my first swimming lesson was the product of a full month of planning and required the sacrifice of several weeks’ salary for bribes. I went to sleep that night ignorant of my _Baba_’s plans, dressed in pajamas my _Aai_ had lovingly embroidered, head full of my bedtime story about a fish named Matsya and a great flood. Still, I awoke before _Baba_ touched me, some preternatural signal jolting me into alertness. He handed me a rough piece of clothing and helped me pull it onto my body. I went to wear my sandals, but he shook his head. He held my hand and led me through our quiet flat onto the balcony.

We stood in the cool night breeze for a moment before he patted his shoulder. I took my cue, jumped up onto his back, and clung there like a monkey. He inched his way down the fire escape, feet silent against the metal. I had many questions, but I held my tongue, because even a five-year-old knew the severity of curfew.

A full moon hung low and ripe in the sky, lighting our way. _Baba_ slipped down alleyways, hugging the shadowed walls. Not all of Mumbai had streetlights, but _Baba_ wove in and out of streets as though he had a map that connected our apartment building and the Bay of Mumbai. The roar of the ocean, once a distant sound, grew louder and louder, like a _rakshasa_ in one of my storybooks, hungry for little girls.
