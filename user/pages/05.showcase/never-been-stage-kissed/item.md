### Query

Please consider NEVER BEEN STAGE KISSED (80,000 words), a young adult rom-com that would appeal to theatre lovers, readers of Jenny Han and Morgan Matson, and anyone who enjoys a woodsy summer camp setting similar to Kasie West’s _Sunkissed_.

Goofy theatre geek Jorie Conners loves playing minor comedic characters––until her high school boyfriend Travis glows up and starts landing lead roles. When he asks for a break from their relationship for the summer, Jorie decides that landing a leading role at their summer-long, sleep-away theatre camp is her best chance to prove she is Travis’s equal and win back his heart. 

When the camp director’s mischievous son Kellen hijacks her audition and throws her off her game, Jorie gets stuck as an understudy and is forced to watch her “we’re-on-a-break” boyfriend cozy up to her gorgeous longtime rival. Since Kellen is a showbiz kid––and since he owes her big-time––Jorie convinces him to give her acting tips so she can prove she’s just as talented as the leading lady. If she can finally earn her moment in the spotlight, Travis will see she can be more than just a side character in his life.

But when Jorie and Kellen share an onstage kiss at the midsummer Family Night Showcase, everything changes. Jorie shines onstage, and the "practice" kissing with Kellen feels all too real as Travis takes notice and inches his way back into her life. Before the end of summer, Jorie must not only figure out which love is real, but also find out if she’s got what it takes to be a leading lady.

Chapter One

Watching my boyfriend Travis kiss another girl isn’t my favorite thing in the world. But it’s fine. Because they’re not _really_ kissing. It’s just acting. 

I grip the thick, silky curtain rope in both sweaty fists as I peer from offstage left into the spotlight, spying on the two of them like a creeper. A creeper who is super proud of him, despite the unforgiving knots in my stomach. 

But I totally get it. What kind of amateurish high school play would it be if Prince Charming and Cinderella didn’t kiss at the end? They have to. And they have to really sell it. Like they’re about to do right now. 

“Pssst, Jorie,” a whispered voice comes from the darkness beside me, “I would so not be able to handle this if I were you.” Alani Hale, a freshman dressed as a mouse––complete with large fake ears, a bonnet, and a painted-on nose––stares past my shoulder at the couple onstage. 

“Handle what?” I give a foggy look, like I have no idea what could possibly stress me out about this situation.

“My boyfriend kissing another girl. Like _that_.” Alani nods to the pair onstage who are now entangled in each other’s arms, lips locked, as the finale music swells. “I would die.” 

I narrow my eyes involuntarily. Most of my expressions are involuntary––theater kid problems. “It’s not that big a deal. Professional actors do this stuff all the time.” My line sounds rehearsed, and no wonder. _It’s just acting_ has been on repeat in my brain throughout the dozens of fights––er, discussions––Travis and I have had on this very topic over the past few months. That, and _no big deal_. And _chill out, Jorie, you’re being dramatic about nothing_. 

But in truth, I could go the rest of my life without having to watch this scene again. Lila’s sparkling blue eyes frozen in that bright, false, acting look she gets when performing. Her pink lips curved into a perfect smile while she makes heart eyes at my boyfriend, delivering her lines in a voice as sickly sweet as buttercream frosting. She must wonder what Travis thinks of her. How he feels about kissing her. If it excites him. If he compares it to kissing me. I keep reminding myself I’m the one who sleeps in Travis’s red sweatshirt every night, not her. 

“They’re really going for it, huh?” Alani whispers.

“What?” My eyes flick back to the stage. My boyfriend’s lips are still suctioned to the face of a girl who is not me, in this strange world where that’s supposed to be okay. I watch in horror as his hand slides around her waist, pulling her ballgown-clad body flush to his. _Whoa, now_. We did not agree to that. 

Red hot jealousy flashes through my body and pounds in my temples as he lifts his other hand to her face and caresses one of her long, blonde tendrils. 

“Real convincing, Travis,” I mutter, squeezing the curtain rope even tighter. 

“He’s such a good actor,” Alani agrees, misunderstanding my tone. Or not. I can’t tell if this girl only came over here to taunt me. “And he’s so cute.”

“I know he’s cute,” I snap, and Alani flinches.

Travis is a good actor, so maybe it is just acting. That’s half the reason I fell for him three years ago during our first show, Into the Woods, back when he was just a scrawny freshman. He was perfect as the gangly, boyish Jack (as in Bean Stalk), and I got a voice crush on him the moment he sang about giants in the sky. The range, the power, that husky breaking point… 

My mind goes a little haywire. This may be the last show of the run, but I can’t take it anymore. All I see is my boyfriend’s hands and lips on another girl. A pretty, perfect girl the exact opposite of me.

I can’t look away. 

_Please, Travis. Just look at me for a moment, so I know you’re still mine. Blink twice. Anything._ 

But he doesn’t. I accidentally pull on the curtain rope, causing it to move just a bit. I steady myself and examine the length of those cords all the way up to the pulley system at the very top. A thought comes to me in a flash of inspiration: I have the power to end this. Right here, in my very hands. No more stage kisses, no more touching, end of Cinderella, end of all my problems. 

It’s not exactly my job to pull the curtain, and there is still one more dance lap around the stage and Lila’s final line about happily ever after, or whatever. But it feels right. Now is a good time for this play to end.

A rush of adrenalin hits me. Arm over arm, I haul the satiny rope until the two gigantic red velvet walls flap together in the center, eclipsing Travis and Lila in total darkness. 

Poof. Kiss over. Just had to use a little stage magic. 

Immense relief and satisfaction overcome me as their shadowy forms separate, and the audience breaks out in applause.

“What the hell was that, Jorie?” A flashlight blinds me, but I know the angry voice belongs to Mandy, the know-it-all stage manager who can’t resist bossing everyone around.

I drop the curtain ropes and play innocent. “There was no one over here, and I didn’t want anyone to miss the cue.”

She yanks her earpiece out. “We still had sixteen measures of music and a line of dialogue. Stay in your own lane and don’t do other people’s jobs.” 

“Sorry. Should I open it again?”

Mandy lets out a disgruntled moan and raises her voice for the rest of the cast backstage. “Places for the curtain call.”

Gathering my sizable, fake potbelly in my arms, I shuffle toward my spot in line with all the other minor characters. Prince Charming and Cinderella slip offstage and into the swirling mass of costumed students. I sneak up behind Travis and pinch him just below his hip. 

_Can’t do that, can you, Lila? Nope, because he’s all mine again._

He whirls around, his expression turning sour at the sight of me. 

“Good show, Charming.” I slip my arm around his waist and take in the feel of his solid form under the starchy waistcoat. 

Travis twists out of my grasp. “Not now.”

I step back, noting his tense shoulders and furrowed eyebrows. “What’s wrong with you?”

“I saw you pull the curtain,” he says with a hiss. “And you know the scene wasn’t over.”

My face burns. “I was just…” It’s no use. Travis crosses his arms and glares at me, the corners of his mouth pointed down like a cartoon frown. My stomach swirls, guilt and regret coloring all of my choices of the last three minutes. “I’m sorry?” I stand on tiptoes to give him a quick peck, but he takes a sharp step back and holds up a hand.

“I’ll talk to you after.”

“Okay. I’m sorry,” I say again, but he only gives a strange, pained look before rushing off to his place in line beside Lila. I adjust the hideous gray mustache on my upper lip, blinking back tears. 

Jaunty curtain call music bursts forth from the orchestra pit, and I snap into actor-focus, sticking the oversized monocle over my eye. I transform my seventeen-year-old body, hunching into the painful posture of my character: the elderly, potbellied Lord Pinkelton. 

But as I step onstage and the audience bursts out laughing, my head isn’t in it. Flutters rip through my chest, and not the good kind that come after a great show. I get through my choreographed bowing bit on autopilot, and the crowd howls and cheers, as they always do when I hobble across the stage and make exaggerated “old man” facial expressions. 

This will all be fine, though, I’m sure of it. Travis and I will fight after the show, and that will suck. I’ll apologize, and he’ll get over it. Then things will go back to normal. I won’t have to loan him to a princess any longer, so there will be nothing else for us to fight about for a long, long, time. 

The whole cast joins hands at the edge of the stage. In unison, we swing our arms up and down in a bow, then repeat. My best friend Charity’s parents and younger brother stand, clapping high above their heads and whooping in our direction––enough cheering for the both of us. They know no one else is here for me tonight. 

The curtain closes on our final bow, and I rip off my mustache, glancing around for Travis. The chaotic stampede of other students rumbles around us as everyone funnels toward the hallway and the dressing rooms. Lila brushes against me in her pink tulle ballgown and passes by as if I’m invisible.
