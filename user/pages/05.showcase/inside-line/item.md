### Query

Seventeen-year-old Justine Kwong has one goal: to become a Formula 1 champion. The problem is, no female driver has come close. Ever.

After years of sacrificing a normal teen life to pursue racing, Justine is offered the opportunity of a lifetime to move to England and drive in Formula 3. She’s one step closer to her dream, even if most of the paddock—her handsome but obnoxious teammate Cameron Owens foremost amongst them—thinks she’s just a “check-the-box” diversity exercise.

Eager to prove she’s more than the token girl, Justine takes a risky on-track gamble that ruins both her and Cameron’s pre-season and results in heavy hostility between the two. Their mutual resentment escalates when they become leading contenders for the only open Formula 2 seat—the next rung on the ladder to F1.

As punishment for their constant bickering, their team principal tasks Justine and Cameron with the tedious task of re-assembling a vintage race car. As they work side-by-side, she learns there is far more to her teammate than his arrogant, pretty boy façade.

With the racing season underway and time in her contract ticking, Justine must not only figure out how to reinvent herself—on and off track—to secure the F2 seat for next year, but also navigate her increasingly complicated feelings for the teammate who stands in the way of her F1 dreams.

INSIDE LINE (~80,000 words) is a contemporary YA that combines the tone of _Not Here to Be Liked_ by Michelle Quach with the adrenaline-packed world of Netflix’s_ Formula 1: Drive to Survive_.

Mom always says you never forget your first love.

Which is a complete lie, because I can barely remember what my first-ever racing kart looked like the second I lay eyes on Lizzie, my F3 beauty.

She—all sixteen glorious, gleaming navy feet of her—stands resplendent in the middle of our team garage. Her top speed is 160 mph, the fastest I’ll drive in my life—so far. My body hums with anticipation, energy rushing through my veins as if I just chugged a gallon of Red Bull.

“Easy, Kwong,” Cameron Owens, my teammate, smirks. “I think you might be drooling.”

I clap my hand to my chin. My skin feels damp, slightly clammy with nerves, and maybe on the verge of a whitehead, but there’s absolutely zero dribble.

I glare at him. We only met a few weeks ago, but there’s already two things I definitively know about him: 1) he’s fast—my biggest competition for the F3 drivers’ championship; and 2) he derives an inexplicable joy from torturing me. On their own, either would be enough to put someone on my shit list. Combined, he has speed-run his way to number one.

“Lighten up, it’s just a little teammate-to-teammate banter before we kick off the season,” he bats his unfairly long eyelashes at me.

Another infuriating thing about Cameron Owens: he’s the classic, swoony type of handsome that wouldn’t look out of place in an Old Hollywood movie. It’s just not right someone with perfect cheekbones and cologne-ad hair should have this rotten of a personality.

“Can you take your annoying somewhere else?” I roll my eyes. “You’re ruining my pre-driving vibes.”

“How ‘bout you wankers quit jibber-jabbering about ‘vibes’ and get on the track?” Frank, our team principal, has somehow snuck up on us despite being shaped like a high school football coach with the tread of an elephant. I blame Cameron.

“Of course, absolutely sir,” I flush, partly with nerves, partly with irritation. I did not move across an entire ocean and skip senior year of high school to have my first public outing in an F3 car ruined by my obnoxious teammate.

“I told you before, no need for that ‘sir’ crap.” Frank shakes his head.

“Yes, sir. I mean, yes, Frank. It’s cool if I call you that, right? Because—”

“Get in the car, Justine.” He turns and lumbers back to his seat on the pit wall.

“Yes—” I choke back the ‘sir’ just before it comes out of my mouth. I can see Cameron smirking at me again from the corner of my eye, so I slam my helmet on to avoid looking at his shit-eating grin.

_Here we go_. I take a deep breath and turn back to Lizzie. Pulse flickering, I lower myself into her cockpit and slide into the black carbon fiber seat. It’s a perfect fit, designed just for me.

No, really, I had to sit in a butt mold for three hours so they could tailor-make it. Sitting still for the length of an _Avengers_ movie kind of sucked, but it’ll be worth it when I win my first race in Europe, lock in the championship, and prove that I belong with the big boys.

I flip my visor down, my heart pounding.

This is it. My professional debut in Europe. What I dreamed about from the first time I set foot on the go-kart circuit at the Illinois State Fair. What Mom and I used to fantasize about while road-tripping to races, spinning wilder and grander “What if?” scenarios with each cornfield we passed.

The safety panel on Lizzie’s steering wheel lights up one-by-one, and I tap the accelerator. She glides down the pit lane, past the garages of the other F3 teams and toward the hallowed peaks of Montserrat towering in the distance. Once we hit the race track proper, I drop the throttle.

Lizzie hurtles down the circuit at 80, 100, then 160 mph. My heartbeat accelerates along with her, the familiar rush of joy and adrenaline sweeping over me. No matter where I am—an F1-grade state-of-the-art circuit with the Catalan mountain range as backdrop, or a muddy Midwestern junior track that doubles as a cow pasture on weekdays—the thrill of the first burst of speed never fails to make me feel like I’m soaring.

Turn 1 comes at the end of the long opening straight. My foot slams the brake down at the last possible millisecond. Lizzie’s speed drops instantaneously, my torso straining against the six-point harness. Three g-forces bear down on my body, roughly the same amount an astronaut experiences during a rocket launch.

There’s an ear-splitting screech behind me. In my left side mirror, Cameron is coming around the corner, a cloud of smoke issuing from his front right wheel as he locks his brakes from mis-timing the turn.

I let out a gleeful cackle. He may have more experience racing open-wheel cars, but so far I’m looking better on track.

We both decelerate to enter the upcoming chicane—back-to-back turns that form an “S”—and Cameron manages to slip past me before we’re out of the second turn.

Pre-season testing is far from a real race, but I don’t want Frank and the rest of the Orbital F3 team to see that Cameron can drive faster than me anywhere. I want to—_need_ to—show I can hold my own, to dispel any doubts I’m here for reasons other than pure merit.

We come up on another turn, this one a wider curve that allows Lizzie to carry additional speed into the corner. Cameron, just ahead of me, is already braking, moving slightly wide and leaving a slim gap.

I see my opportunity. It’s risky, but it makes a statement.

I keep my foot on the throttle until I push past the conservative braking line. Lizzie turns, smooth as a skate slicing through freshly re-surfaced ice. Except Cameron hasn’t gone as wide around the turn as I thought he would.

I turn the wheel to adjust my racing line, but it’s too late.

There’s a sickening crunch as our cars collide, carbon fiber on carbon fiber. I’m jolted to my right, and then left, as Lizzie and I spin away, ‘round and ‘round like an out-of-control Disney teacups ride. We skid off the tarmac and come to a stop in the gravel lining the track, the smell of burnt rubber so thick in the air I almost gag.

I quickly scan for any bodily damage. My toes can wiggle, my wrists can flex. My left shoulder is burning from the force of the harness strap that held me in, but other than that all facilities seem to be intact. No bruising, no internal bleeding.

I look around for Cameron. His car is also stranded in the run-off area, sixty feet from Lizzie. He hops out of his cockpit, clearly no harm done there either.

I take a deep, shaky breath. Thank god I’m okay, and thank god my opponent is okay, too. The only thing worse than what just happened—crashing the car in front of the entire paddock—is getting yourself or another driver wheeled off on a stretcher in front of the entire paddock.

My legs are rubbery as I push myself up out of the cockpit, my heart jackhammering against my rib cage. Part of me wants to curl up next to Lizzie’s mangled front wing for a second—just until my fingers lose the tremors—but the track marshals sweeping toward me like a Navy SEALS rescue mission remind me I’m still being watched. And judged.

I take a second deep breath, forcing oxygen through my body to calm my rushing nerves.

“Kwong!” Cameron’s stomping toward me, gravel crunching with each step. There’s no trace of a smirk, or anything remotely resembling a smile, on his face now. “Are you mental? I had the inside line.”

My stomach drops, but now’s not the time to back down or show weakness. It never is when you’re the only girl on track.

“You were six feet wide, I went for the gap,” I shout back, with more confidence than I feel.

“Six feet isn’t a gap.”

“Maybe to you it isn’t.”

“It shouldn’t be to you, either.” He comes to a stop inches in front of me. He glowers down, almost a full head taller.

Frank gives a piercing whistle that cuts through the air, even a hundred yards away from the other side of the circuit. “My office, _now_.”

Cameron and I share a heated glance as I follow him off the track. This time, I’m in no hurry to be first.
