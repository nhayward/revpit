### Query

Circuit is an anxious mechanic employed in his adoptive father’s toy shop, making dancing figurines and parade dragons while secretly wondering about the family who abandoned him. When an officer conscripts Circuit into the ongoing war between science and magic, Circuit must build bots made of an alloy he’s never seen before and only one metalworker has ever been able to manipulate. 

While working, Circuit meets the alluring and deadly Asher, a half-human, half-bot designed to become a perfect soldier. Except Asher’s hardware keeps malfunctioning, preventing him from getting revenge on the man who replaced his limbs with parts. Circuit is the only chance Asher has to fix his tech, and Asher may be the key to finding the answers Circuit seeks to his long-lost past. Tension between them grows as Circuit works to fix Asher’s tech and unwittingly distracts Asher from his plot to claim revenge.

When Circuit accidentally melts imobinium alloy with his bare hands, he is accused of being a metalworker spy and must decide to escape with Asher’s help or suffer torture at the hands of the army that conscripted him. 

THIS METAL WAR is a dual-POV character driven Young Adult science fantasy novel complete at 75,000 words. It meshes the worldbuilding of _CRIER’S WAR_ with magic akin to _FULL METAL ALCHEMIST_. It features LGBT+ characters and #ownvoices for anxiety.

I’m a writer from Texas and have been published in magazines and newspapers both online and in print, including a short story titled Beneath in the _Writer’s Games Anthology_. I live with my adorable Australian Shepherd son and I adore soft characters with hidden strengths.

CIRCUIT

Grimy fingers flitted along gears and coils with practiced ease. Loose screws whirled tight and excess oil disappeared beneath a filthy rag until everything gleamed gold and silver. A clang sounded over the rumbling machine. Thick metal walls trembled around Circuit where he crouched in the belly of the draconic beast, and a sharp voice cut across the hiss of steam.

“Circuit, hurry it up! It’s almost show time!”

The boy inside the contraption scrambled for his tools and shoved them into the leather pouch slung around his shoulder. He adjusted the pack out of his way and climbed back through the tangles of pipes, cords, and gears to the small hatch just large enough for him to squeeze out of and stepped onto the small ladder awaiting him. Covered in oil and grime, Circuit clambered down.

At the bottom of the ladder, Gerat awaited, his graying hair standing at ends and his warm gray eyes alight with energy. “Everything working?” His large hand fell on Circuit’s shoulder. Gerat, Circuit’s adoptive father, was a bear of a man, with broad shoulders and a thick mustache beneath a rounded nose. He could break a full-grown man’s neck if he wanted to, but Circuit hadn’t ever seen him get angry, much less violent.

“The dragons are ready,” Circuit breathed, his heart swelling with pride. “I fixed the gas valve on Zinc so it doesn’t get so hot inside and the smoke funnels out instead of in. I was wondering if I could ride—”

A mechanic rushed by and slammed into Circuit’s shoulder, spinning him from Gerat’s grip. The warehouse was abuzz with activity, the bay doors open to admit the sunlight and a relatively cool breeze that was welcome on Circuit’s heated neck. His hair clung to his forehead from sweat and grease, and he swiped at his face as he jogged to catch up with Gerat. 

The man hadn’t seemed to notice as he spoke, waving a hand. “…long as you stay out of sight and it’s safe, you can ride.”

Circuit beamed.

Around them, dancers hurried to their corners to practice, all dressed in bright blues and brilliant reds between flashes of skin. Men and women concealed beneath large furry costumes hustled by with animal heads tucked beneath their arms, their faces flushed with the heat, and other mechanics brushed by to finish up the final touches on the animatronics they’d helped lovingly create in the past few months.

Circuit and his dad climbed the steps at the far end of the warehouse and turned to observe the chaos going on down below. With no small amount of pride, Circuit observed the large-scale animatronics he’d helped build and cultivate; there were four in total, each one bigger than the last and ranging in colors and design. Two of the beasts were painted gold, one a dull yellow and the other a rosy pink, while the third was a light silver and the last a dark, intimidating gray. The largest one, the gray, had only a few wistful designs on its sides and snout, accentuating the long twist of its body. Circuit’s favorite, however, was the small one; it was a relatively plain gold but adorned with thin swirls and decorations depicting flames and encrusted with jewels, two of which were emerald and formed the eyes.

Four dragons, curled and ready to pounce, their frames taking up the majority of the warehouse. They seemed even bigger in the sunlight, looking to have swelled with the attention. Beside Circuit, Gerat set his hands on his hips.

“We’ll steal the parade this year,” he boasted, his eyes glinting. No doubt he was thinking of all the business it would attract to his shop. Circuit couldn’t blame him. With war tearing apart northern Esetheas, not a lot of people bothered with toys anymore. 

The front end of the warehouse, where Circuit worked, was Gerat’s toy shop, The Winking Dragon. He’d just signed the lease on it those twelve years ago when he found a small four-year-old boy sitting on the curb, abandoned and lost. Gerat had handed the little boy a toy to play with while he asked people nearby about him. He’d come back to find the boy had torn the toy apart and was in the process of rearranging the circuits. Ever since then, Circuit had lived with Gerat with no knowledge of his family or his real name. When he asked Gerat about it, the man insisted he had no idea who had left the boy on the curb. Gerat kept his ears out for years, just in case someone came looking, but no one did. So Circuit fixed cars and wagons and built toys with Gerat, and despite the mystery hanging over him, Circuit was happy. Gerat took care of him, taught him, encouraged him. He was all the family Circuit needed without one of his own.

Dancers shouted in the corner, drawing Circuit’s attention as they called out their five, six, seven, eight! They moved in confident, swift motions, their bodies twisting and arms rising and falling with an elegance that no machine Circuit had yet seen could master. He could recall only a few of the dancers by name. Most were older by several years, and Circuit had seen them put on plays and dances in town square. Most of them would be doing so tonight after the parade.

Circuit still recalled last year’s performance; men and women had been painted in vibrant colors, telling the story of two lovers who were destined to never be together. The men had all but tossed the elegant women into the air, their faces stoic and arms rippling in the low firelight. Circuit had had a front row seat. He recognized one of the men from before, now standing in his shop and speaking to a woman in a tutu and felt a small twinge in his gut.

A heavy hand landed on his shoulder, nearly knocking Circuit from his feet.

“Let’s make sure things run smoothly this time,” Gerat hummed. Circuit’s cheeks warmed with the reminder of the rather disastrous test a few weeks ago and nodded avidly. Their oldest mechanic, Elroy, was still attempting to grow back his eyebrows.

Before he could say more—though he usually didn’t—Gerat squeezed his arm and nudged him toward the stairs. “If you’re going to ride, get in one now. We kick off in a few minutes. I can already hear the trumpets going.”

Circuit caught the sound of music far off, carried on the wind. The realization made the already chaotic room erupt, dancers taking their place in the yawning mouth of the garage and entertainers reluctantly plopping their fake animal heads on their shoulders. Circuit secured the bag on his shoulder before rushing down the steps toward the smallest dragon he’d named Zinc. 

He wove through the crowd, dipping beneath elbows and around dancers towards the open duct cut into the dragon’s belly. Circuit slid underneath and pulled himself inside, using the handle to snap the door shut. Inside was dark, the air thick and warm. The comforting smell of oil and grease filled his nostrils and Circuit settled into a pocket at the base of the dragon’s neck. If he crawled forward, he could see out of its mouth directly, but he remained back for now so he wouldn’t be seen.

Circuit kept his ears trained, and through the pronged teeth spotted the first group of dancers head for the garage opening with a dramatic sweep, followed by a few people in costumes. Gerat bellowed excitedly from the top, and Circuit scrambled towards the innards of the beast. It all may appear to be a tangled mess to anyone else, but to Circuit, the gears and switches were as familiar to him as his own body. Circuit flicked on two silver switches and slid a dial far to the right.

The engine below the tail rumbled, sending the whole thing trembling, and the walls around him began to quake. With a small groan, the body lifted. The metallic legs hissed as they let out steam, the pistons popping as they rose, and with that, they began to walk.

Circuit crawled back up through the lumbering body to peek out the front. The garage opening drew closer as Zinc followed the path preset into the dragon’s software. The other mechanics would have just flicked their switches and closed the hatch, letting the beasts move on their own. 

Above the rumble of the engine and the clank of its shaved claws against concrete, Circuit could barely hear anything. He envisioned the other two dragons lining up behind him by size, the biggest one—the gray one, Rhodium—at the very back. Circuit shifted forward as the dragon stepped through the garage opening. Heat swam in through its mouth and Circuit flicked on the small fans he’d installed on either side of the creature’s jowls. Above the rumble of the engines, music blared around him. Drums and cymbals and trumpets and violins sounded, ringing out a happy, patriotic Esethean song.

Through the dragon’s mouth he spotted the dancers twirling between each other, their dresses now fully unfurled and long skirts flicking and flowing brightly as their bodies moved with listless confidence down the street. Rows and rows of people lined the wide road, leaping at each other’s shoulders and waving Esethean flags. They all had flushed faces and bright eyes, children holding sweet treats and flailing their arms while their parents hoisted them on their shoulders or hips.

Circuit crawled closer, pressing his chest to the warm metal and lowering his head so he could better see their faces as they caught sight of the dragons. The crowd immediately roared, and when Circuit found it appropriate, he reached up and pulled a small lever.
