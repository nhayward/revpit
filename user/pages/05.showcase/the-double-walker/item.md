_Once the Fetch is freed, don’t let it feed._

Twelve-year-old Noa is struggling to cope. With no friends, and only her mystery writer mom who suffers from severe depression to lean on, Noa hopes their move to a new home in a small town will be the spark her mom needs to come back to her. All Noa has to do is find a mystery like one of her mom’s plots—something so intriguing she’ll have to take an interest. But with Noa’s grandmothers keeping a close watch, and her mom withdrawing further from their prying eyes, Noa knows time isn’t on her side before the family intervenes—the exact opposite of what her mom wants.

Luckily, their new house is layered with old secrets, and it isn’t long before Noa finds a strange door in the basement. But when the door fails to interest her mom, and her grandmothers circle closer to the truth of her mom’s depression, Noa struggles to keep their life in order and the family at bay. 

That’s when the mysterious door offers help in exchange for Noa’s blood, sweat, and tears. But the last thing Noa expects is her own doppelganger to manifest. What starts as a partnership between the two Noas—sharing chores, clothes, and tough conversations—soon becomes a twisted game of cat and mouse as Noa’s mirror image seizes control of their life. As Noa grows weaker with each passing day, and her doppelganger connects with her mom by enabling her withdrawal, the promise of help becomes a dangerous threat to her mom’s chances of recovery … and Noa’s chances of survival

**CHAPTER ONE**

The house stood, door open like a gaping portal to a new life.

But Noa lingered in the car. Shoulder to shoulder in the backseat with her mom, she watched strangers move their boxes into the unfamiliar house under the watchful gaze of Noa’s grandma, Mamie. Mamie’s arms waved as she pointed at different windows, a phone in one hand and a roll of paper towels in the other. Their voices hummed like the radio on low, filling the silence, but not the distance between Noa and her mom.
 
Noa stretched her legs, restless after hours in the cramped car. Her mom leaned her forehead against the glass, her seat belt buckled across her chest as though she hadn’t realized they’d reached their destination. The stillness wrapped around Noa’s neck like an itchy scarf. She tugged at her collar, trying to think of something to say that might bring her mom back to the present, from wherever she’d drifted off to in her head.

“We’ve never lived in a house before,” Noa pointed out, tapping her pencil against her sketchpad.

“Mamie arranged it,” her mom said, and Noa sat up straighter, relieved to hear her speak. “It’s only for the summer,” she added, rubbing her puffy eyes. “Then I’ll have written another book. We’ll go back to the city. Everything will fine.”

Their home had always been small apartments on busy streets where the buildings twinkled like stars at night.

But here, there were no buildings in sight—not even other homes.

Shrouded by a knot of twisted oak trees—that all leaned _away_ from the grey stone house—their new home existed alone at the end of the street. Noa shivered in its lonely shadow, longing for all the neighbors she’d never taken the chance to get to know, and for all the city lights that seemed a thousand miles away.

Everything seemed miles away, as if the town had known better than to build near the house.

Shadows waved on the glass panes, three stories of windows with rotten wood frames. _Two people could get lost in a house that big_, she thought. She twirled her pencil around her fingers, pushing away her worries. Her mom wouldn’t get better if Noa stressed her out. _Be a sail not an anchor_, she reminded herself. She needed to pull her mom forward, not drag her down.

The tower of boxes near the front door looked like a flagpole declaring the house theirs. Mamie had insisted they bring all their stuff. Why pay for storage? Their rental had space.

Darwin whined beside Noa, his tail wagging against her leg. Wet nose pressed against the window, he begged to explore his new surroundings. Noa scratched his head, her other hand lingering on the handle.
 
Once she opened the door the work would start. Bags to unpack and rooms to clean and meals to cook. Her mom wouldn’t want her parents’ help. If they stayed too long, they might realize something was wrong. Noa would take care of everything. It was easier that way. She closed her sketchpad. There would be time to draw after she finished her work.

“The house looks nice.” Noa bumped her mom’s shoulder reassuringly then turned towards her, seeking reassurance. “We’ll have fun, right?”

The change of scenery held a promise of mystery. Her mom wrote spooky novels for a living, and loved old houses where secrets papered the walls, layers upon layers as every generation added a pattern. The house—with its wraparound verandah and rounded corners bulging like cheeks either side of the red front door—drooled secrets.

A sharp tap on the window startled Noa. Her sketchpad slid off her lap and landed at her feet. 
Claudia, Mamie’s wife, stood by the car, a warm smile on her thin face. She waved at them both, gesturing for them to follow.

Noa pressed the red button, releasing her mom’s seat belt. Darwin’s ears twitched hopefully at the loud click.

“I’m waiting for a call.” Her mom pulled her phone from her pocket, the dark screen cracked from a bounce on the subway steps.

Picking up her sketchpad, Noa tucked her pencil behind her ear and sighed at the weak lie. Her mom’s phone was dead and she’d lost her charger on the train. But the lie didn’t matter since they couldn’t stay in the car forever. They’d already run out of snacks. Noa clipped on Darwin’s leash and grabbed the door handle. “Let’s go—"

“Please,” her mom interrupted, clutching the phone. “Tell them I’ll be out soon.”

_I’ll get up soon … I’ll be better soon … I’ll be out soon_. Her mom waited for a call, and Noa waited for soon, and neither was coming. But Mamie and Claudia couldn’t know.

Noa climbed out of the car with Darwin and closed the door behind her. 

A muggy summer heat gusted in her face, a faint hint of lavender on its breath. In every flower bed, against every stone wall, lavender swayed, wild and overgrown. Darwin sniffed the nearest purple bush, before lifting his back leg to pee.
 
“I thought you two were planning on living in my car. The movers already finished unloading your boxes.” Claudia laughed. She looked back towards the car where Noa’s mom sat alone, and a worried frown deepened the wrinkles on her forehead. “Everything okay?” she asked.

“She’ll be out _soon_.”

Noa let Darwin yank her towards the porch steps where Mamie stood.

“Isn’t this place beautiful? It’s one of the oldest houses in Nelson. Very historic.” Mamie tucked the roll of paper towels under her arm and smoothed out the wrinkles on her yellow linen jacket. “How was your trip?” She kissed both Noa’s cheeks and patted Darwin’s head.

“Nice. We had window seats. I saw a moose.” She had sketched the moose long after the train had sped by, scrunching her drawing into a ball when her mom said the antlers looked like arms. 

“You look more like your mom every time I see you. Hopefully, you’re spared her awkward phase,” Mamie said, turning to Claudia. “Remember the blue hair? Let’s enjoy twelve before teen angst steals you from us.”

Noa rolled her eyes. Ever since she had turned twelve a few months earlier, all her family could talk about was the approaching _teen years_. As if her life was a pencil outline, and twelve didn’t matter because thirteen was ink that would redefine her lines.

“I know the move was tiring, but is your mom happy to be here?” Claudia asked, unclipping Darwin’s leash to let him roam. He took off into the garden and darted around the side of the house. 

“Yes.” Noa snapped a stem of lavender from a neglected wilted bush. She twirled the thin flower around her finger. Dry buds fell onto the gravel like purple paint drops.

“Well, let’s unpack what you need for the summer and we’ll stash away all the other boxes. If Gigi gets out of the car, we can get to work.” Mamie checked the time on her watch.

“Mom and I can unpack later,” Noa said.

“I’ll go talk to her. Make sure this change isn’t causing too much stress. She’s going through a lot at the moment, so let’s watch out for any signs of relapse.” Claudia slipped into her professional voice—a doctor discussing a treatment plan.

_Signs of relapse_. Noa ripped the lavender stalk into pieces until there was nothing left. Her mom had gone through a couple of _creative slumps_, but none had lasted longer than a few weeks … until this one. Three months of long silences and getting up later and going to bed earlier and cereal dinners and missed events all blended in a palette of blues. They had passed the signs and only Noa had seen them. But her mom didn’t want Mamie and Claudia to know. Noa was helping her get well, so she wouldn’t upset her by telling them.

“Thank you!” Mamie waved at the movers as they rolled down the truck door.

Noa turned toward the house, all rough stones and brittle mortar and peaked roofline and long windows. Dried ivy clung to the chimney, as though the vines had tried to burrow their way in, only for the structure to prove stronger. There were haunted house vibes, and she couldn’t help but shiver, but maybe the change would be good for her mom. A new chapter in their story. If the house helped, then Noa would sketch the shadows and make friends with any ghosts. Because the only thing scarier than a haunted house was a haunted gaze.

_But what if the house makes her worse?_ She brushed the thought aside before doubt spread its roots.

“Let’s have a look around.” Mamie ushered Noa up the porch steps and onto the dark verandah.

Noa took a deep breath and hugged her sketchpad, worried about the shadows that lay behind and ahead, but wishing for the best as she stepped through the door and into the unknown.
