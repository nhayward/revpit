### Query

Finding the Golem of Prague wedged inside her bathroom is not how Magda’s Friday nights normally play out. A Jewish witch with damaged magic, she knows she needs backup to wrangle the legendary clay monster. Only Eitan, her synagogue’s cantor, can help with this supernatural philosophical mystery, but he’s also the one man she can’t stop thinking about. Unfortunately, as a sharp-tongued woman with split faiths and a talking spider for a roommate, Magda isn’t girlfriend material for a clergy member, and Eitan seems too pure of heart for a woman like her. Besides, once her magic fully heals, she’ll be back on the road as a ghost bounty hunter and out of his life.

Eitan, a former punk with a rap sheet, has turned his life around and moved to Triptych to get a job, start a family, and leave his past in the past. Settling down is hard to do, though, when a distractingly clever witch needs help with a golem who wants to become human. As Eitan and Magda struggle to transform him into a modern man, the good cantor finds himself falling for his most unusual congregant anyway.

In search of a quick fix, the golem recklessly sneaks into the Afterlife to change his destiny in the Books of Life and Death. It’s up to Magda and Eitan to save him from himself, but time is running out. Desperate to save her new friend, Magda discovers the key to healing her broken power. But now that Magda can reclaim her career and Eitan is finally building roots, they must decide if their newfound relationship is worth sacrificing the lives they’ve fought to build.

Complete at 98,000 words, ABOUT A GOLEM is an adult paranormal romance with upmarket style. It has the flawed witches of an Alice Hoffman novel and Christopher Moore’s levity and humor.

My debut novel, _Bloodsucking Lawyer_, will be released with Limitless Publishing in June 2019. I work as a technical editor in Chicago, and I’m also a member of the Romance Writers of America. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

### First Five Pages

CHAPTER 1

There was a woman dancing in the cemetery. Eitan sighed and tugged the back door to the synagogue shut behind him.

“That’s what you get for staying late,” he muttered to himself and fought with the deadbolt until it slid home with a reluctant clunk.

Triptych was a spot for oddness to be sure, though small towns usually were. The question was whether he should engage the strange. In the last six months, he’d dismissed little hiccups of weirdness. Examining them too closely might make him question his decision to move here, so he’d focused on what mattered: his job and putting down roots. 

Eitan jiggled his keys in one hand and ran his fingers over the smooth velvet of his tallit bag in the other. His feet, fingers, and shoulders wanted to go home. Some things couldn’t be ignored, though. Such as that woman dancing in the cemetery.

She wore a white dress, her long dark hair bouncing and swinging in time with her movements. He heard singing, too faint to catch the melody since the old graveyard rested at the edge of the temple’s property. Granted, it was a beautiful evening with a watercolor sky and amused green trees, but that still wasn’t an excuse to be dancing around tombstones. His decision was made.

Eitan dropped his keys into his pocket and headed toward the cemetery, passing tools the maintenance team had abandoned against the side of the synagogue. The long shadows of a broom, rake, and shovel loomed in the fading light.

He kept his pace steady and measured as he crossed the lawn, tidy and green, and he soon reached the graveyard’s chipped wrought-iron fence. While the resting place was old, it wasn’t unkempt, either. No one had been buried there in at least a century, but nothing was overgrown or matted. Landscapers took as much care of it as they did the rest of the temple’s peaceful grounds.  

Finally, he got close enough to hear what she was singing. He immediately recognized the cheerful gust of the _V’_ and the determined upswing of _shamru_.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_V’shamru v'nei Yisrael_</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_et HaShabbat,_</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_laasot et HaShabbat l’dorotam_</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_b’rit olam._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Israel shall keep Shabbat,</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observing Shabbat throughout the ages as a covenant for all time.

In that moment, Eitan realized three things:

1.	The woman couldn’t sing worth a damn.
2.	Misty white ghosts were dancing with her.
3.	He knew who she was.

He paused outside the cemetery gate, unsure what to do with himself. The ghosts had no problem with such a decision and evaporated into the quiet summer evening as soon as they saw him. A laugh that was equal parts trepidation and amazement got stuck in his throat like a movie that couldn’t get greenlit. So they _were_ real. After hearing yet not seeing the spirits for months, he’d started to wonder if he was imagining their melodic whispers.

Commanding center stage, Magda Greenberg stood atop a tombstone, hands on her hips and her back to him. Her white cotton dress fluttered at her knees, and she wore braided leather sandals. He stared up at her, larger than life. She looked like Peter Pan, daring someone, anyone to catch her shadow. With a dancer’s elegance, she leapt onto another headstone but noticed mid-jump something had scared off the ghosts. Her head jerked back in time to see him watching her. Her grace dissolved as she accidentally kicked some rocks stacked on top of the grave marker. 

She lost her footing and promptly fell into the grass with a hard _thump_. 

“Oh shit,” Eitan said, which wasn’t quite the thing to say as a member of the clergy, but old habits die hard. 

He rushed through the cemetery gates and crouched down next to her. “Are you OK?”

Magda sat up with a grunt and leveled him with an unimpressed smirk. “Compared to what?”

Eitan leaned back, not sure there was a right way to answer that. Since she hadn’t hit her head on anything, he rose to let her gather her bearings. He offered her a hand to help her up, but he wasn’t surprised when she waved it away. Magda stayed away from most people in the congregation; even handshakes with them turned her brief smiles a bit sour.

As she dusted herself off, the silence stretched taut between them. He busied himself by putting the rocks and pebbles back on the offending headstone, setting to rights the tributes to the dead. Stone met stone with small, satisfying clinks. Eitan straightened and considered excusing himself from the bizarre situation entirely. 

Magda dropped her hands to her sides and said, “That was quite the interruption, Cantor Holtz.”

They were an informal Reform congregation. Literally no one called him that except her. And maybe Tom. But Tom was a smartass. Eitan could never tell if it was her own private joke with herself or if she was trying to be respectful and unintentionally came across as officious.

Flustered, Eitan ran his fingers through his short hair and tried to figure out how to respond, but instead accidentally knocked his _kippah_ off. He bent to retrieve it from the grass and clipped it back into place with a grimace. 

“Sorry. I saw someone dancing and thought it was strange.”

“It is strange,” she agreed.

He frowned. “So why are you singing Shabbat songs with ghosts in a cemetery?”

“I do it once a month near the full moon.”

Eitan knew this shouldn’t surprise him, but it did. He was used to her being weird, but not like this. Magda was a loner in the congregation, usually dressed in black with silver rings on most of her fingers. Never mean, but she always sat at the back of the room by herself during Shabbat services. Afterward, she would sip on a paper cup full of lemonade and smile wanly at anyone who offered conversation. 

She also had a tendency to stare, as if she were reading his soul for interesting gossip. Even the rabbi, who had a soft spot for Magda, admitted to finding her disconcerting. Whenever Eitan spoke to her, she stuck to pleasantries and deftly avoided giving away any personal information about herself. 

“Why?” he asked, though he asked it of himself as much as he asked her.

Why had he chosen _this_ Friday to spend way too much time reviewing the notes for his upcoming Torah study class? Why had he left out the back door instead of the front? Eitan scowled, annoyed his thoughts were perilously close the standard Passover question, _Why is this night different from all the others?_

“The dead may be dead, but they still want to celebrate Shabbat,” she said matter-of-factly. “_Their_ Shabbat.”

The dead. He swallowed as the truth of the situation settled more firmly into his consciousness. 

Magda swished her skirt in her hands. “They don’t bite, I promise.”

Eitan’s eyes widened at the movement. Was she being _playful_? He tried to shrug off the notion. Magda didn’t do playful, and he needed to understand what this was. 

“Do you give a sermon?” he asked.

She smiled. “No, they just like the tradition of the songs and some of the prayers. Reminders of life.” She eyed him curiously. “For a fresh-faced city kid, you don’t seem like you want to run for the hills, though.”

It was his turn to be droll. “Not yet, at least.” This all confirmed his suspicions, though. “Let’s just say the temple was built nearly two-hundred years ago, and I tend to work late. I’ve never seen them before, but I’ve heard them.” 

Magda leaned toward him conspiratorially. “What do they say?”

She _was_ being playful. This was their first conversation about anything of substance, and he wouldn’t have expected to enjoy sharing secrets with her in a graveyard. 

“They like to moan along when I’m practicing,” he said.

The first time it had happened, he’d nearly jumped out of his skin. While they still unsettled him a little, he couldn’t see the harm in letting them sing with him. Besides, they were pretty good at harmonizing. 

A knowing smile pulled at her lips. “See? Told you they like to celebrate.” She glanced back at the aging tombstones. 

“Seems disrespectful to stand on their headstones, though,” Eitan said.

Magda looked up at him with the hauteur of a duchess and nodded at his shiny brown Oxfords in the grass. “You think standing on top of their bodies isn’t?”
