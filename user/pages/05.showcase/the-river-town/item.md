### Query
Hugo’s carefree teen life changes when his father is killed and thrown into the river cutting through his small town. The murder might be related to several recent drownings, and whether there’s truly a link or not, all Hugo wants to do is research these incidents in hopes of uncovering the culprit’s identity. When his mother tells him she has invited her childhood friend—and said friend’s very attractive son, Callan—to stay with them, Hugo realizes that his life is about to change yet again.

Callan doesn’t just love the water—he needs it more than most, being part human, part mythical water horse. His kind are known to attack and drown humans, but Callan is a gentle soul trying to live a normal life. When meeting Hugo, and learning of his plight, Callan is caught between wanting to help his new friend solve “the drowning mysteries” and worrying about what such research may uncover. The truth of the water horses must remain secret at all cost, and Callan won’t betray his own kind, or himself. Even for a boy he is falling more for every day.

While navigating their feelings for each other, Hugo and Callan gather clues that indicate the drownings are indeed the work of something supernatural. Hugo realizes he has been caught up in something bigger than his father’s murder, and Callan must choose between keeping his identity a secret, or losing his newfound life—and Hugo—forever.

THE RIVER TOWN is a queer YA speculative mystery that may appeal to fans of _The Taking of Jake Livingston_ and _Cemetery Boys_ and is completed at just under 88,000 words.

### First Five Pages

**Chapter 1**

Hugo tore a page from his sketchbook, crumpling another failed drawing then tossing it in the trash. He sighed, worried his art block would never let up. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, if it didn’t—he wasn’t a good enough artist to ever make a career out of it—but it still frustrated him that he had hardly drawn a thing in the past several months.

Hugo put his pencil to a fresh page, ready for another attempt, but paused when he heard the door of his father’s office shut down the hall. It must have been his mother, but he didn’t know why she had decided to go in there all of a sudden.

He got up from his desk and left his bedroom. The door to the office was a little ways down the hall, still hanging open. Inside, his mother surveyed the space, her hands on her hips in that stance she took when she was about to get to work. Hugo asked, “What are you doing?”

The older woman jumped. “Ay, mijo! You scared me.”

“Sorry.” Hugo leaned against the inner door frame, frowning as he waited for her to explain.

She dusted off her perfectly clean suit pants and said, “Well, I was just taking a look at the office. It’ll have to be cleared out by the end of the week.”

“Cleared out?” Hugo repeated, too stunned to say anything else. Dread washed over him, cold and gritty like the only ocean waves he had ever known.

Several years ago, he had visited the Oregon coast with his parents, finding it nothing like the warm, southern beaches seen on television, with the sunshine glimmering off bright blue waves and populated by fit and tanned surfers.

He recalled the freezing cold water, the dreary atmosphere tinged with salt and the acrid scent of rotting seaweed, and his father’s voice, laughing, ‘_Not at all like the beaches in Mexico. Someday I’ll take you, mijo. You’ll love it!_’

Hugo didn’t much care for the ocean—or any other body of water, really—but thought he would have liked that. Time passed, his father continuing to mention the possible vacation here and there. It had been so difficult to pull him away from his work. ‘_I think…for your sixteenth birthday_,’ he suggested. ‘_That’s when we’ll go_.’

He died just a couple months before the proposed date, and now Hugo hated water more than ever. He knew it wasn’t logical: according to the autopsy, his father hadn’t drowned in the river that ran through their small town. He was already dead—had already been murdered—before being dumped there.

Hugo swallowed a lump in his throat. Still standing in the doorway, he asked, “Why?”

“Well, it was originally a bedroom,” said his mother. She smiled, and it was less sad than it had been these past several months. “That’s why we picked this house. All the bedrooms. We knew your father would need an office and…we wanted to have more children.” 

Hugo nodded. He knew the story of his parents, Miguel and Maria, and how they bought this four-bedroom home in a small town because they had wanted to have a typical, big Catholic-Mexican family. It may not have worked out that way, but they had always seemed happy, and Hugo had never minded being an only child.

Hugo’s question hadn’t been answered but, after a moment, his mother continued, “I’ve invited an old friend to come live with us. She’s fallen on hard times, and I realized that I could help. And use the company.”

Again, Hugo found his question unanswered. “She’ll stay in the guest room?”

“She has a son. You’ve met him once, but you might not remember. You were very small.”

“Oh.” Hugo wasn’t sure how to feel about any of this, but at least his question had finally been answered. The office needed to be packed up, turned back into a bedroom, for this other boy he couldn’t quite remember. “What was his name, again?”

“Callan,” said Hugo’s mother. “¿Te acuerdas?”

“I think so.” Hugo could almost recall it now. He was about five or six, and had spent a summer day playing in the backyard with another kid his age. “He’s white, right? Blond?”

Maria nodded. “Yes. He was really a sweet boy. Took after his mother.”

The only thing Hugo had seemed to inherit from his mother was his curly hair. In every other way, he was his father’s son. Miguel Alvarez had been a small, almost delicate man with a soft, gentle voice and graceful mannerisms. He was artistic, and had been kind of a nerd in his youth, much like Hugo was now. He had been an architect.

Hugo looked around the office. All over the walls were framed prints of his father’s stylish designs and glossy photographs of the buildings after they had been constructed. 

“So, Callan will be staying in here?” Hugo asked, for clarification’s sake. It made the most sense, because the room was connected to the other side of Hugo’s bathroom, Jack-and-Jill style. It would be more appropriate for two boys to share, while Callan’s mom could occupy the guest room on the other side of the house.

Maria nodded, the gold necklace she wore, adorned with a small crucifix, glistening slightly in the dim light. “Is it okay?”

Hugo still didn’t know what to think, and his insides had gone numb. “Can we put these pictures up in the halls or something?” he asked, stepping further into the office. “I don’t want to just pack them away.”

His mother smiled. “Yes, we can do that.”

***

Callan loved the water. He loved swimming. He couldn’t believe he had spent the past five years of his life in Nevada—the literal driest state in the country—but he and his mom were finally getting away. They were moving to the Pacific Northwest, a place of streams and lakes. The town of Bentrun, Oregon was just an hour or so drive to the ocean, and had a river snaking right through the center of it. Callan had never even touched a real river before.

Nearly more exciting than the river and ocean was the fact that Bentrun High possessed a prestigious swim team. From what Callan had read, the local coach—Jacob Irving—was the best on the west coast, and had guided several swimmers to the State Championships.

“You know, there’s no guarantee I’ll even make the team this season,” he mentioned to his mom, feigning humility. And yet, he doubted he’d be beaten by the students at Bentrun even if they did have a quality coach. Even if they had spent their entire lives swimming through rough ocean waves and treacherous river currents.

“Oh, you should have said something earlier,” Callan’s mother, Piper, responded. “Maybe before Reno?” She pulled her blue eyes from the interstate to wink at him.

They both knew the real reason for the move. Callan and his mom had been in dire need of a new start on life and, when an opportunity finally presented itself, they packed all they could fit in the back of their trusty Chevy pickup and set out to the northwest. Five-hundred miles later, Callan couldn’t wait for their horrendously long journey to be over. 

At last, his mom flipped on her blinker and took the exit into Bentrun. 

It was a small town, he could see from the drive down Main Street, but not tiny. According to his mom, the population was nearly thirty thousand. Sharp, cyan mountains surrounded them on every side and, before long, they were taking the bridge over the Emerald River. Callan leaned out the passenger window to peer down at the rushing water. The river was wide and it really did have a blue-green tint to it.

He had been ignoring his thirst for the past couple hours, and this sight brought it right back. Again, he forced the discomfort from his mind. They were almost to their destination and he could hold out a few minutes longer.

The Alvarez family lived on the north side of town, up a winding and scenic stretch of road called Azalea Terrace. Coming around a gentle bend, Callan saw the hillside home with its modern urban-rustic aesthetic—all brown, wood-paneled surfaces and dark trim, and big windows that glowed gold, as if lit from within by an old-fashioned fireplace. Just after they had parked in the driveway, the front door opened to reveal a middle-aged Mexican woman, her umber eyes crinkling with a smile at the sight of her long-time friend.
