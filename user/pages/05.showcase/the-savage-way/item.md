### Query

For traumatized ex-sniper Ryoko Mori, asteroid miner _M.M.S. Kedalion_ is the perfect place to hide from herself and everyone else. As the ship’s engineer, she can raise her ten-year-old daughter and her sentient AIs in peace while ignoring the memory of the people—the person—she killed during the Lunar War. 

All hope of peace is shattered when aliens capture their ship and all aboard—including Ryoko’s daughter and beloved AIs. Ryoko and the rest of the crew are imprisoned in a high-security military research lab on a hostile planet, where they’re forced to battle alien soldiers in deadly experiments. Determined to escape the lab, evade the military, and flee the solar system, they build an alliance with the other prisoners, innocent and criminal alike. Ryoko must pick up her rifle again, fighting through spiraling guilt and debilitating panic attacks to free her child and find her missing AIs. If she can’t reconcile the sins of her past with the needs of her present, Ryoko and her daughter will be test subjects in the Pit for the rest of their lives—and “the rest of their lives” may be all too short. 

Complete at 118,000 words, 2020 RevPit-winning novel THE SAVAGE WAY is a standalone multi-POV adult space opera with series potential. Its ensemble cast and themes of self-acceptance and found family will appeal to readers who enjoy character-driven science fiction such as _The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet_ with the action and suspense of _The Murderbot Diaries_ and _Embers of War_.

CHAPTER ONE

At the edge of human exploration, the _M.M.S. Kedalion_ clung to a half-harvested ice asteroid suspended in the darkness of the Kuiper belt. 

Outside on the ship’s mining platform, Ryoko Mori supervised the hammer-arm as it pounded the last bits of ice from the stony core. It was inefficient, but it couldn’t be helped. There might be ancient RNA fragments inside—at least, that was the hope. 

She caught movement at the corner of her eye and spun to face it. Jagged chunks spun past her head into the vacuum. She gritted her teeth, trembling. It was ice, not bullets or plasma bolts—nothing to worry about. The Lunar War ended years ago. Ryoko inhaled for four beats and held it for another four. She exhaled, still counting, and her hands steadied.

She was safe.

Ryoko grimaced as sweat trickled down her neck. Her scalp itched beneath her spacesuit’s cap, but it’d be another hour before she could go inside for a break.

At the other end of the platform, Birdie Mahoney, the captain’s nephew, steered the collector’s drag sail toward the debris the hammer had knocked free. Out of habit, Ryoko let her gaze drift across the void behind him in search of oddities. A twinkle caught her eye. She frowned and shifted to face the distant sun. That couldn’t be right.

“Birdie, you see that?” Ryoko asked over the comm.

_“See what?”_ Fatigue from their early start thickened Birdie’s Lunar accent. He sounded like he should be having tea with the Queens of England instead of doing EVA work on an asteroid miner. 

“That weird smudge beside the sun.” 

_“How can you tell which one’s the sun this far out?” _

“That’s what those star maps you’re supposed to study are for. Behind you, just above the starboard latching-arm.”

Birdie turned to scan the sky. _“All clear. I do believe you need to clean your spacesuit better. There’s probably gunk on your helmet.”_ 

In the glare of the spotlights, Birdie’s pristine spacesuit gleamed the same blinding white it had the day his aunt gave it to him two years ago. His suit belonged in an ad photo, not on a working asteroid-miner. Ryoko’s own suit was dingy from years of accumulated dust and ore stains. Only the liberal application of neon pink reflective tape kept her from looking like a large smear of space dirt, but her faceplate was spotless—there was something out there. 

Maybe she could knock Birdie into an ore bin. Accidentally, of course. 

Were they leaking something? No, green lights on all the consoles. She adjusted the angle of the latching-arms and checked the Kedalion’s position. Thirty years of mining runs in the asteroid and Kuiper belts had faded the ship’s vibrant candy red finish to a muted, rusty color. She concentrated on the steady vibrations of the engine thrumming against her mag-boots. The Kedalion might be getting on in years, but Ryoko kept it purring as if it were a day old.

She searched the familiar stretch of stars behind her once more—nothing. Had she imagined it?

_“Sector scan’s almost done, Ryo,”_ said the captain’s son-in-law, Olivero Chavez, over the comm. _“Keda and I’ll check out your smudge.”_ 

The pilot waved at her from the other side of the bridge’s viewport. Even lounging at his console, Olivero’s tall, fit form still bore the upright posture that came with military training. Bright blue and black prosthetics, souvenirs of their last war mission, replaced his right limbs. Pale scars climbed the deep bronze skin of his neck, leftovers from the shrapnel damage that had destroyed his right lung and half his rib cage. 

Ryoko didn’t envy Olivero’s comfy seat inside. The bridge’s cooling system had broken during the night, turning the insulation shielding the ship from radiation into an oven. Sweat streaked his shirt, and his dark hair stood up in damp spikes. 

A Celtic song began to play over the comm. 

Birdie groaned. _“Not again—can’t you play something decent for a change?”_

_“Driver picks the music,”_ Olivero said. _“Made a twelve-hour playlist just for y’all.”_

_“Did he find his birthday present yet?”_ Birdie asked on Ryoko’s private line.

Ryoko waved him away behind her back. “We’ll know if one of them goes off.”

_“It better work. I spent weeks on that dye formula.”_

“Keda promised to record it.” 

Ryoko grinned. Birdie could be a pain, but his custom dyes were the best she’d found for her little surprises. Olivero would get them back, but it’d be worth it.

The remaining ice broke free from the asteroid, and Ryoko deactivated the hammer-arm. Birdie caught the last of the debris and waved. She waved back and checked her monitors. Her comm clicked again, and Olivero’s New Savannah drawl replaced the music.

_“How y’all doing out there? Scan should finish up in a minute.”_

“Ice-harvest cycle’s complete,” Ryoko said. “We’re prepping the latching-arms for the ore cycle. I had to de-ice the hammer-arm, and a bunch of paint flaked off. Cap can’t avoid a new paint job much longer.”

Olivero chuckled. _“It’s on the list. Marisol’s lobbying for glittery purple.”_

Ryoko laughed. Olivero’s daughter thought everything should sparkle. “Most teenagers hit that phase. She’ll grow out of it.”

_“Maybe.”_ Olivero raised an eyebrow at her, smiling. _“I recall a certain grown engineer wearing sparkly pink nail polish during our last shore leave at the Outpost.”_ He wiped sweat out of his eyes. _“You gonna fix the A/C soon?”_

“It’s on the list.” Ryoko made a mental note to paint Olivero’s nails the same color next time he fell asleep watching movies. Her manicure needed a touch-up, anyway. “The fabricator’s printing the part now. I’ll install it after I check on Kana’s entry exam to see if she earned that cat for her birthday.” 

Birdie deactivated the collector and tugged at the sail, reeling it in to stow.

_“Guess that’ll have to do.”_ A hint of a sigh hid in Olivero’s voice. 

“Sorry, Ollie. I had to print the big piece for the sorting bin first, and it took all night.”

_“No prob. Swamp-rats like me can handle a few hours in the heat. Does Kana know she’s getting her cat no matter what she scores?”_ 

“Not yet—she needed a reason not to slack off. You sure you’re okay? Cuddles can set up the fans.” Ryoko’s sentient AI assistant was proctoring Kana’s exam, but he should have time to grab the fans from storage. 

_“He set  ’em up while Kana was eating. I’m okay until you fix things.”_

The comm clicked off, and Ryoko’s attention returned to positioning the latching-arms. 

Something brushed her helmet, and she leaped back with a yell—counter-snipers. She’d been spotted. The safety line pulled taut as she fumbled for a gun that wasn’t there. Her mind filled with the scents of juniper trees and gunfire. A bullet pinged her helmet, she was falling—

_“Birdie! Watch that sail!”_ Olivero’s voice cut through the memories. _“You’re losing bits.”_

Ryoko froze, chest heaving. Her heart squeezed, and her suit’s bio-monitor chimed a warning.

“Just ice.” Ryoko forced away the junipers. Her tongue stung where she’d bitten it, and she gasped for breath. “Just ice, just ice—”

_“You’re all right, Ryo,”_ Olivero said, his voice gentling. _“Nothing out here but us. Just breathe, Ryoko—four beats. Focus on the checklists.”_

Olivero wasn’t the only one with scars. 

Ryoko pulled up the ore-harvest cycle’s checklist and filled her lungs, willing her pulse to slow. Her hands kept shaking, but the panic calmed enough for her to work. She’d finish outside, and then she could show Kana photos of the cat waiting for her on Earth.

She breathed.

Olivero had better hurry up with that scan.
