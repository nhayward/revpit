### Query

When 17yo Grey goes to LA to attend a college credit course, he does so thinking it’s the perfect excuse to spend the summer with his boyfriend. But when they break up, he realizes that being trapped in the same class with his now ex is going to be _rough_ to say the least. Especially after said ex told Grey he didn’t ‘want his summer ruined by his helicopter vibes’.

Grey decides a rebound hookup is obviously the most logical choice for dealing with heartbreak. But when his hookup, Andrés ends up also being in his college credit course, the two devise the perfect revenge plot—to show his ex that he’s not some boring goody-two-shoes, Grey and Andrés decide to fake a summer fling. This means lots of adventures around the sun-drenched city and lots of highly suggestive social media posting. However, as the two tour the city for both revenge and their course, Grey finds himself falling head over sneakers (everyone in LA wears sneakers apparently) for Andrés. And Andrés, who has jumped headfirst into Grey’s revenge plot to distract from the growing divide between himself and his friends, finds himself enthralled with Grey as well.

But the constant presence and after-class conversations with his ex, cause Grey to realize he doesn't know how he wants this revenge-plot to end. With his ex ... or with Andrés. These conflicting feelings also cause him to confront who he is, and who he wants to be. Does he want to continue being so future-focused he misses out on the things around him—or does he want to be someone who lives and breathes in the moment? Like he has been during this glorious summer with Andrés by his side. 

A TOUCH LIKE STARLIGHT is a dual YA contemporary standalone romance novel that will appeal to those who loved the cute, will-they-won’t they of TWEET CUTE, but the realistic truth of growing up and moving forward of FELIX EVER AFTER. It is complete at 86,000 words. This is an #ownvoices novel with LGBTQ black and brown protagonists, and it was selected as a winner for the 2023 RevPit Annual Contest.

I earned my B.A. in Journalism and a minor in sociology which greatly influences my writing and character development. I had the pleasure of using my real-world job in advertising in helping me craft the college-credit course that Grey & Andrés attend. The first five pages are below as per your guidelines. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

### First Five Pages

**Grey - 1**

I know it’s a bad idea before I press download.

But I do it anyway, feeling a weird mix of vindictive satisfaction and nerves crash through me as the app begins to download. I mean I’m _technically_ on summer break, and you do technically _only_ live once. I’m also _officially_ single.

Like a time bomb, I watch the gray clock tick down before the app pulls into focus, staring right into my face. Pink, with a cursive scroll of the letter “C” in blue. 

It’s a gay hookup app.

My _first_ gay hookup app. But … I’m ready. I think. It’s not like I haven’t dabbled in the more unsavory parts of the internet before—ugh. I can’t think about that right now, I’ll lose my nerve.

My thumb wavers over the app before I click it. It flashes open before it asks to use my location. 

_Los Angeles, CA_

2,626 miles from my home in Virginia. 

Unfortunately—I’m only 10.7 miles away from Tony. Because I had the _great_ idea that a LA summer vacation with my then-boyfriend would be the most romantic thing. 

Well—until he broke up with me. Because I ‘didn’t know how to live life’. Because I ‘was going to make LA boring too’. Because I hated his friends. No quotes … because the last one is true.  

I take a breath. I would prove him absolutely wrong. LA is my time to be different—but he didn’t even give me the chance to show him that I could. 

_I can be different_. The thought echoes around my skull, and it steadies my hands, and evens my breathing as I focus back on the app.

I confirm the use of my location and rectangles of men pop up, each highlighted by a stark pink boundary. I click on my profile, mulling over the prompts it has given me.

Username. I ponder this for a moment before I type in Ouran. A play-off my last name that so happens to be the name of one of my favorite anime. 

Age? 18—a lie. 

Gender? Male. 

Orientation? Gay. 

Ethnicity? Black. There’s no option for out-of-place black boy who grew up in white suburbia. 

Position? Blood rushes to my cheeks—and other places—and I leave it blank. 

Interests? I leave that blank as well.

Pictures? Damnit, not pictures. 

I glance through my pulled-up camera roll. Tony and I walking around the mall. Tony and I posing at some gardens. Tony and I at a park. 

Maybe I should have Robin dress me up and do a photoshoot. She’d love to get a hold of my wardrobe as she’s said … twelve times since I landed. 

I landed 2 days ago.

I skip pictures and get a notification. Since I’ve elected to not put photos I’ll only be able to chat and be seen by other faceless people. Great. All the more reason to get that photoshoot.

My phone chimes suddenly and the phone eagerly tumbles away from my fingertips and onto the charcoal-shag rug beneath me.

I sigh at myself, before I pick it up, frowning. A message already?

_**ANON84** - Dick pics?!_

A twisting spark of frustration shoots through me. I should have expected—another chime. I turn my phone on silent, seeing someone else message.

_**GIFTED12** - New here? Wanna have sex?_

I am now very much regretting downloading this app. I mean … I am looking for more than friendly conversation. But, I’ve never … well not really ever hooked up. Just dated two boys, and … whatever Dan was. Could have been if I hadn’t been such a coward. 

I shake my head, in hopes I can send the thoughts flying. I do need a friendly conversation to happen first before anything else. But … I’m 17. I’m ready for a hookup which seems like such a gay stereotype, but why does society hate the idea of casual sex? Why can’t I decide to—

A knock on the door has my phone teetering out of my hands and onto the charcoal shag rug. It settles with nary a sound and I sigh, turning toward the door. Maybe one day I won’t be so excitable. 

“Come in?” so weird to be saying that—it’s not even my room.

The door slams open revealing my cousin. She’s wearing _adorable_ short overalls over a mustard ribbed t-shirt, with one clasp undone. And then—chunky black heels and a face full of elegant makeup.

“Heyyyyy little cous, you wanna come out with me?” she asks with a mischievous grin. “9 pm is the witching hour. Especially Memorial Day Sunday.” 

Her smile is bright white against her dark skin with its golden olive undertones. She’s the type of black girl that white people _love_ to ask if she’s mixed because of how the golden undertones brighten her whole complexion like she’s shining from underneath her skin.

“But I’m 17!” 

“You don’t have a fake?”

I sputter in protest, but she just laughs at me.

“Don’t worryyy, I know all the bars in WeHo that won’t ask for an ID if you’re with me,” she says with the sorta rebellious nonchalance I envy. “But I know you wouldn’t have a fake. Your parents would have a heart attack.”

“Even if I had a fake, it’s not like they let me out of the house anyway,” I reply with a frustrated sigh.

“Well, you successfully convinced them to let you fly out here, so I say that’s a win. And this summer, I have every intention of corrupting you.”

Of this, I have no doubt. Robin’s always been the wild cousin. And by that, I mean my _favorite_ cousin. She oozes confidence, charm, beauty, maturity, and pure, unadulterated fun. Everyone’s always asking who my idol is—and Robin always comes first to mind. Why pick a celebrity I’ve never met when Robin is everything I’d love to be and more?

“You can corrupt me another night. I have to prep for my summer course tomorrow. And I don’t know if I’d be able to prep after—well … however you’d leave me after a night out.”

Robin gives me an exaggerated shrug, the warm lights of the room caressing the sparkling gold glitter that brushes her cheeks. 

“Fineeeeee.” Each extra ‘e’ is laced with exasperation. “But we’re hitting the town next weekend!” 

The idea of ‘hitting the town’ with Robin, gives me a weird surge of both terror and excitement. The two emotions draw their blades against each other as they war in my mind.

Robin doesn’t see the internal fight as she scans the room with a lazy intensity, her eyes making snap judgments as she looks. “Sorry, my old room is so drab.”

I can’t imagine how _this room_ feels drab. 

Hanging pothos—their rich green leaves reflecting the soft purple of my cousin’s lights—trail from the ceiling, forming graceful arcs against the window. Her vintage, wooden desk is really just a glorified plant stand. Plants of every variety sit around that desk—monsteras, purple orchids, a philodendron cream splash, and a really large fantasy venice. 

My cousin loves plants _almost_ as much as I do. 

“I’ll see what I can do,” I lie.

She nods, like her worries about her drab old room have been lifted. “Well, I’m off. But just so you know, this was your one ‘no’ of the summer.”

“What?!”

“You heard me!” She says all too cheerfully, already closing the door behind her.

As soon as she’s gone I’m hit in the gut with regret. My instant terror had won out. I should have said yes. But baby steps. I don’t need to rush going out with Robin on my first night. I did download that app for a reason…my eyes travel to my phone which is still face-down on the rug, the aged, starry cover full of scratches from the many times I’ve dropped it.  
	
I plop down against the rug, picking it up. Nerves—and excitement—flood through me,  my stomach doing an almost pleasant roll. I turn it on to see an Instagram notification against my lock screen.

_‘Tony posted a story for the first time in a while’ _

I nearly drop my phone again.

I fumble with my password, a roar starting in my ears as Instagram pulls up and I see the little ring around his profile. We ended _terribly_.

_“You’re weak if you’re not even able to stand up to them. And they’re stupid.” My words._

_“How dare you call my friend stupid!” His words._
_
“They are and what’s more stupid is the fact you let them walk all over you.” Me. Again._

_“So I’m stupid too, now?!” Him._

_“I mean I didn’t call you stupid, but if the shoe fits, then maybe.” Me._

It wasn’t pretty, to say the least. One single fight that had spun and spun further out of control until it was a vicious tornado ripping apart everything we’d built together the past nine months. All gone.

_“You’ll never change! Always trying to control my life and my friends. You’re such a helicopter boyfriend! LA is going to be terrible with you there.” Him._

Those sharp words had done a number on me. My fingers grip the shag carpet, as I desperately try to find comfort in the thick, wooly fibers. I guess if I’m being honest—maybe the words lingered like cactus barbs precisely because of how true they were. 

I’ll hate myself for this . . . I click his story.
