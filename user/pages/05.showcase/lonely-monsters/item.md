### Query

Days before their high school graduation, Ashina Yuu’s childhood friend disappeared in a pool of blood.

Years later, Yuu lives a mundane life in the city of Xr Jing, only to discover Evan is alive after she saves him from a mysterious attacker, setting off an explosive chain of events that lead to the dangerous truth. Yuu is the reincarnation of Xr Nae Rimin, the blood-soaked emperor who sold his soul to a demon, and Evan was the man who killed him—Ri Ifhan, once his closest advisor, son of a god and keeper of the seal that still imprisons the demon that slaughtered thousands.

Together, they descend into the magical underbelly of Xr Jing, racing to save his seal from shadowy forces hellbent on ripping apart Yuu’s soul and freeing the demon. But Evan is not the girl he knew, and in her place is a ruthless stranger with her own secrets. Yuu becomes increasingly drawn into Rimin’s memories, watching the young prince rise to power and fall for the one person he cannot have. Torn between past and present, Yuu must break an old cycle of trauma and betrayal to save them all from a fate worse than death. 

LONELY MONSTERS is a queer, adult urban fantasy set in a reimagined modern-day Beijing featuring complex relationships between morally ambiguous characters that will appeal to fans of R.F. Kuang’s Poppy War trilogy. It contains generational trauma and reconceptualized ancient lore within a contemporary setting in the same vein as _The Book Eaters_ by Sunyi Dean. The manuscript is complete at 117,000 words.

I graduated in 2017 from Duke University where I studied foreign policy, economics, and English literature and moonlighted as a spoken word poet. LONELY MONSTERS is a culmination of my experiences as a queer, Chinese-American daughter of immigrants.

CW: Violence, homophobia, mention of suicide, disordered eating, mention of sexual assault.

### First Five Pages

It wasn’t every day a man offended the gods. 

It was close to midnight now, the clock ticking down the minutes to his birthday. Twenty-four. He winced at the sacrilegious number. Bad enough it would be his zodiac year, but he was turning twenty-four on the very first day of the new year. A double blasphemy. 

Yuu trundled along the sidewalk, shivering from the cold, eyes bleary from lack of sleep. Red lanterns hung from each streetlamp, and cheerful paper fu blessings adorned the doors of nearly every apartment building he passed. A few windows even displayed the traditional cuttings, intricate dragons and phoenixes painstakingly carved out of scarlet paper. He turned off from the main road, and the new year crowds began to thin out, the hustle and bustle of car horns and firecrackers dying down to something more like his sleepy hometown. He had always loved that about Xr Jing—one subway stop could make a world of difference. 

His footsteps slowed to a stop before the Anjing temple, lit by a single streetlamp. Nestled on the very edge of the city’s fourth ring, it still attracted a decent crowd on the new year. Even this late at night, people milled around the grounds, eager to start the year with a blessing. Like the streets of Xr Jing, the temple had strung up dozens of red lanterns, small and glowing. He watched as a father hoisted his small daughter to a piggyback. The girl pointed delightedly at the nearest lantern, making grabby motions. Despite a faint pang of loneliness, Yuu smiled, his breath frosty white in the chilly air. 

_Chuxi_—new year’s eve—had come and nearly gone. He bypassed the main temple building and its long line of well-wishers altogether, shuffling off to the side where a solitary lantern illuminated a path into the bamboo forest. It was darker here, with only the occasional glowing paper lantern to guide his way through the forest. He passed through a large ceremonial gateway, careful not to step on the elevated doorsill and risk further offense to the gods.

In the darkness, the monolith appeared suddenly, rising up high above his head. Time had worn away at the traditional characters carved into the stone, declaring it a place of memorial and mourning. At its base was a traditional incense burner, sticks lit for the dead slotted in neat rows within the smooth sand. Most of them had gone out, only the faintest hint of woody smoke on the wind.

Yuu slowed as he approached the memorial, contemplating. He couldn’t explain why he had come here, not in any way that made sense outside of his own head. Going through the motions of ritual for ritual’s sake had never appealed to him. It had been years since he had paid his respects, but he felt the urge to do so now. He pulled his glove off, reaching into his pocket for his lighter. The flame took a moment to catch, but then he lit the first stick of incense, and the familiar woody smell drifted over him. 

_Happy new year, mama_. He bowed his head a moment, exhaling. 

When it came to the second stick of incense, he hesitated. He flicked the lighter on, then off again. _Don’t be stupid_. It was past time, even if they had never found a body. 

Still, he couldn’t bring himself to light it, lingering uselessly before the monument. 

In the end, he compromised and stuck the incense into the sand unlit. The lone stick, standing taller than all its burnt compatriots. He cleared his throat, self-conscious. A tendril of smoke curled up towards the moonless sky, and a shiver ran down his spine. 

His throat ached, and he swallowed hard. “Be well.”

Yuu turned away, trudging back towards the main temple grounds. The chatter of temple-goers drifted over the bamboo from beyond the gateway. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a flicker of movement. A woman stood on the other side of the ceremonial gateway, face in profile and turned up to the sky. A heavy scarf wrapped around her neck, dark red wool stark against the severe black coat. 

There was something off about her. Her solitary figure, stark against the flickering light of a nearby lantern and the ancient stone of the gateway, was like something out of an old scroll painting. Though she stood in the direct light of the lantern, the dark shadows of the bamboo forest appeared to lengthen and bend around her. 

He told himself to shut up, keeping his eyes low to the ground, but his heart only beat faster. 

As Yuu stepped over the doorsill, moonlight struck his face. He blinked, tilting his face up to catch a glimpse of a fat moon, high in the dark sky. It was perfectly round, and he squinted up at it, confused. That was impossible. _Chuxi_ ushered in the new year and a new moon with it. A sudden wave of vertigo washed over him, and he stumbled, foot catching in the doorsill.

A hand wrapped around his arm like a vice. He grunted, staggering a little, but remained otherwise upright. His knee crashed into the doorsill, pain jolting up his leg. 

“Thanks,” he gasped. “Sorry about that.”

The woman flinched back as if she had been burned, turning away. 

Without thinking, Yuu’s arm snapped out and caught her by the wrist. She stilled. One end of the scarf unwound from her throat. 

“Evan?” he whispered, disbelieving. 

Yuu stared, the shock punching into him like a fist to the gut. He traced the lines of her. Her hair was short now, dark curls framing her face in a messy bob, her entire face sharper. 

But those eyes, they were the same. Pitch black like the bottom of a well, swallowing the white around them. He saw the moment she gave in, the way she went stiff and her mouth tightened. 

“Yuu.” The dizzying familiarity of her voice, low and strained with tension, hit him like a physical blow. “You shouldn’t be here.”

“I–you—” he stopped. Tried to start again. “What are you doing here? I thought—” 

He dropped her wrist. Realized he was trembling and balled his fingers into a fist to stop. _I thought you were dead_. 

She wasn’t looking at him, eyes darting from the gateway to the memorial and then up to the night sky. When he followed her gaze, Yuu saw that the night was dark as ever, not even a glimmer of moonlight. Had he simply imagined it? he thought wildly. Was he seeing things?

Her brow furrowed. “The new year,” she muttered. “It’s not safe.”

How many years had it been? He looked her over, trying to clock the hundreds of tiny differences from the girl he had known. The Evan he knew had been so young – they had both been so young, practically children. The woman in front of him was a stranger. 

His gut twisted. He had spent long nights torturing himself, imagining what had happened to her. He had long since resigned himself to not knowing because deep down, he did know. There could be no reunion, just a final answer to an agonizing question. If the call ever came, he had known that it would lead only to a shallow grave, bone fragments, nothing living or breathing. 

Lee Evan was long gone from the world. Because if she was still out there – still alive – she would never have left him like that, a severed vein bleeding ceaselessly into the ether. She would never have done that to him. 

And yet. 

“Evan.” His voice came out strangled. “What are you doing? Where have you been?”

She opened her mouth, only to stop. They both stiffened at the sound of footsteps coming from up the path. She seized his arm, pulling him off the stone path and into the bamboo forest. 

“What? Where are we going?”

“Quiet.” Her fingers tightened on his wrist.

Evan yanked him along, navigating deftly through the dense bamboo. The warmth of her skin bled through his light jacket where she gripped his arm. 

She was alive. The thought rattled numb inside of him, a toy inside an empty machine. 

They came to an abrupt stop at the outer wall encircling the temple. Here, the bamboo forest had thinned out, and Yuu could even see the paper lanterns hanging in the main pavilion of the temple grounds. The well-lit temple steps that he had climbed earlier were within throwing distance. 

She dropped his wrist. “You need to go,” she said, speaking in a rapid, low tone. “Take the main roads, don’t stop for anyone or anything, and forget you ever saw me.”

Desperate, he caught her shoulder as she tried to turn away. “Wait.” 

Evan flinched viciously away from him, her arm nearly clipping him in the head. “Don’t touch me,” she snapped. Up close, he saw the fear in her eyes, the minute clench of her jaw. 

Startled, Yuu took a half-step backwards. “What the hell happened to you?” The words spilled from him, unbidden. “That day—there was so much blood.”

She looked away. “I can’t explain it,” she said. “Don’t ask me to.”

“Try,” he snapped.  

“I left of my own accord. That’s all you need to know.” 

“You can’t expect me to just accept that!” He took a deep breath, trying to pull himself together. “Evan, your parents—everyone thinks you’re dead.”

He caught a glimpse of Evan’s expression, twisting into some complicated emotion before her gaze shifted to something behind him, alarm flickering across her face. 

Whatever she was about to say, he never got to hear. Yuu was yanked backwards by the shoulder, and white-hot pain exploded across his face. He staggered back, his arm coming up just in time to catch another blow. Yuu caught a brief glimpse of his attacker, unfamiliar face twisted in fury, and then the other man charged at him. 

They crashed into the ground, the impact knocking the wind out of him. The taste of iron flooded into his mouth, and Yuu realized, panicked, that his nose was probably broken. 

“You motherfucker,” the man hissed, grabbing Yuu by the neck. He slammed his fist into Yuu’s face again, catching him in the eye and nearly crushing his windpipe. Half-blinded, Yuu struggled against his hold, gasping for breath, dark spots threatening to overtake his vision. 

And then suddenly he was free, the weight off of his chest. Wheezing for breath, Yuu rolled over to a surreal sight. 

Evan had pinned his attacker face-first to the ground, grinding his nose into the concrete. He was still cursing up a storm, even as she dug her knee into the small of his back. 

“Shut up,” Evan said. She emphasized the point by tightening the joint lock on his arm.

He howled in pain. “Get off of me, let me go, you bitch.” Wild with fury, he careened between Standard Xr and a language Yuu didn’t recognize. 

“Lang,” she snapped, and the man stopped dead. “Remember where you are.”

“Who are you? Let me go.” Lang craned his neck, twisting around to look at her. 

Recognition sparked as he focused on her face. 

“Ifhan,” he breathed, and now there was fear in his eyes.
