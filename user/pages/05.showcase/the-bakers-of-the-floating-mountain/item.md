### Query

I’m writing to tell you about THE BAKERS OF THE FLOATING MOUNTAIN, a 95,000-word, dual-POV YA cozy fantasy — think _The Great British Bake Off_ crossed with _Howl’s Moving Castle_. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the whimsical magic of _A Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking_ and the cozy atmosphere of _Flowerheart_. 

Baking prodigy Zaya owes her life to the bread sprites who protect her insular valley. Their help came with one condition: She must win her homeland’s once-in-a-generation baking contest, or else the sprites will leech away her baking abilities, leaving her a shell of herself. 

Zaya’s obsessive preparation doesn’t account for the chaos sown by disillusioned junior bureaucrat Gelan, who plans to sabotage the contest — to relieve her boredom, yes, but mostly to get revenge on a competing baker who’s treated her immigrant family like rotten oats. But Gelan’s trick goes spectacularly awry, and she’s mistaken for Zaya and thrust into the competition, while Zaya ends up trapped in the heart of the Floating Mountain.

If Gelan’s appalling kitchen skills get her eliminated, Zaya’s place in the contest will be gone and with it her chance to repay the sprites, so she agrees to help Gelan impersonate her — temporarily. Except with every step forward, Gelan realizes that she needs the win for herself, and the respect it’ll finally bring her family. Each of them bides their time to triumph at the other’s expense — until the bread sprites put a long-hidden plan into motion, tearing apart the competition, the magic of baking, and the valley itself. Amidst the chaos and corruption sewn by the sprites’ magic, Gelan and Zaya must put aside their rivalry and learn to truly rely on each other, or else they may never live to see the end of the contest.

By day, I work for an educational technology nonprofit; by night, I seek out adventures in books, baking projects, and book-inspired baking projects. My short fiction has been published by _Diabolical Plots, Uncharted, Fusion Fragment_, and others.

Thanks for your consideration!

### First Five Pages

**Chapter 1: Gelan**

It was the pickled cucumbers that broke Gelan’s resolve.

Her day in the scribal offices had already worn her near to snapping, with its flood of papers shoved in the wrong places, petitioners demanding _a real scribe, I swear, I can’t have a foreigner making mistakes with this_, and documents that somehow managed to be both mind-numbingly duplicative and devilishly complex. So perhaps it was unsurprising that every logical thought fled Gelan’s mind when, wandering through the market, she spied the stand selling pickles and soy-stewed vegetables: specialties of Schessen, the land where she’d been born.

The orange canopy fluttered between neighbors of white and dun and evening-sky blue, shading rows of barrels with their long-handled ladles. Gelan veered toward it. Her heartbeat tripped and came alive with the promise of her first good trick in half a season. She didn’t yet know how, but she knew that today would end with the sharp-salted-sweet taste of a pickle on her tongue.

The merchant turned his back, attention diverted by a customer. 

Gelan broke into a run. She dashed between the last few stands, dodging people with baskets when she could, and thrusting them out of her way with her scribe’s bag when she couldn’t. Before her brain could catch up with her, she dove into the stall behind the merchant’s back and squeezed between the barrels, breathing hard.

This was not the sort of trick she generally favored. Her favorites were late-night mind games, slights of hand and slights of tongue, cunningly and lovingly wrought during weeks of observation. Those sorts of tricks, carefully rationed to avoid suspicion, were her only antidote against the mindless rule-following that her job as a scribe required. 

Yet here she was. Mindless in a different way, a thrall to a barrel of pickled cucumbers. She hadn’t realized she missed home so deeply — not just her family’s current home on their farm in the north of the Taper, which she’d left four stone seasons ago to become a scribe, but the home in Schessen that she hadn’t seen since childhood.

She could buy a packet of cucumbers. She felt the money in her pocket, enough to ease her homesickness, with plenty left over to send home, and even to buy the fine cotton shirt with the lace border she’d been eyeing.

Except this wasn’t just about homesickness. Gelan pushed farther into the stall, hand slipping out of her pocket. This was about the day she’d just had. It was about the scribal offices. It was about a half-season of pent-up anger, swallowed retorts that scraped her throat on the way down, countless moments when she could’ve told claimants that, yes, she’d been born in Schessen, and yes, her accent and her handwriting were still better than theirs, because unlike them, she’d had no alternative to perfection.

So buying cucumbers wasn’t enough. She needed a trick, something heart-pounding and clever to remind her that she had not yet lost herself. 

The stall was a labyrinth of barrels, lit to golden warmth by a brazier and by the sunlight filtering through the textured tangerine fabric on three sides. From her frequent wanderings through the market in search of fine things, Gelan recognized the material as an import from Aulana, not from Schessen, where the merchant’s foodstuffs originated. But most market-goers would simply perceive it as exotic and leave it at that — the same way they would’ve perceived Gelan’s Schess name, the one she’d buried when she realized that the hard G and clipped syllables of Gelan would roll more easily off their tongues. 

She peered into each barrel as she passed. She only recognized half the merchant’s wares, and her parents had only taught her the traditional preparations and presentations for a few of them, wasting no money on indulgences and especially not the kind that highlighted their foreignness. But Gelan could never have mistaken the salty-sweet whiff from the largest barrel: pickles, better than any others she’d encountered in the Taper. 

She reached for the slotted ladle.

“What are you doing?”

Gelan jumped and cursed.

A sprite fluttered up to perch on the chased bronze rim of the brazier. They wore the appearance of a bird, and a vest that the merchant must’ve knitted, which reminded Gelan of the straw hats that her father wove for the sprites around the farm. The bird-sprite cocked their head and leaned toward Gelan in a very un-bird-like way. 

Gelan hesitated. She would’ve duped the merchant in a heartbeat, but deceiving a sprite was different. Her family’s hearth-sprites had become her first friends after her arrival in the Taper at five years old: strange creatures, unlike anything in Schessen, who didn’t begrudge Gelan her own strangeness.

She could still retreat. She could reach for the wages in her pocket, purchase a packet of cucumbers, and skip off to the aunts’ house where she was staying with both her conscience and the law unbroken.

That future was easy, and quiet, and boring, boring, boring.

Gelan answered the sprite, “I was waiting for you.” Her words slipped and slid without a plan to anchor them — but one was already forming in her mind, undergirded by the memories of a dozen claimants she’d received in the scribal offices. “You see,” she said, and held up one hand to show the stains of her favorite mushroom ink, stark against her light skin, “I work as a scribe at the Conclave.” 

The sprite hopped into the brazier to roll in the coals. Sparks plumed from the fiery bath. One drifted over the rim of the brazier. 

Gelan stamped it out and continued, “Someone came to the scribal offices this morning with a peculiar claim. She said another vendor had taken her assigned plot in this marketplace, and she needed to secure a signed statement of her right to the plot.” Even as Gelan spoke, the final lynchpin of her plan crystallized, and now the words tripped from her tongue, too quick and clever to be stopped. “She told me that the other merchant had not only usurped her plot, but was also selling his wares without a certificate of authenticity. Can you guess what she said the other merchant was selling?”

The sprite regarded Gelan. They sat still amid the coals now, their impertinent expression fading into concern.

“Pickles and soy-stewed vegetables,” Gelan answered herself. Her heart skipped with the thrill of inventing each moment and each word on the spot. “Your stall is the only one in the marketplace matching that description.”

There, she paused. Each passing second saw a higher likelihood of the merchant’s return, but it would do no good to rush things. When she’d given the sprite time to grasp her meaning, she said, “But I don’t want the only decent pickle vendor in the Taper to be banned from the market. You don’t want your home to be uprooted. And we can both do something to prevent that.” From her bag, she took out the seal of the scribes’ office — or rather, the secret copy she’d commissioned when she realized its utility. She let the sprite examine it.

Most sprites were attached to their chosen piece of land, and often to the people who lived or worked there and made the offerings that were a daily ritual in Yerlaai. This sprite was no different. Around the edges of the knitted vest, their feathers stood on end with agitation, and Gelan felt a stronger pang of remorse for causing their anxiety — but the thrill of success overcame it when the sprite said, “What can I do?”

“Being from Schessen, I can assess the authenticity of the wares, and I can issue an official certificate. No one else at the Conclave needs to know about this infraction. All you need to do is let me evaluate the goods.” From her bag, Gelan extracted pen, ink, and a sheet of paper borrowed from the Conclave. She made a show of smoothing the page across a barrel-top.

“Why did you come to me? Why not to the merchant?” the sprite asked.

“Between you and the merchant, which of you is required to file seasonal reports with the Conclave, and might let slip about our meeting?” Gelan countered. “I’ve been away from Schessen for years. I miss my home.” She didn’t have to fake the tremor in her voice. She did miss home, especially after a year of living with Aunt Tsenga and Aunt Kher. It was just that Schessen wasn’t home anymore. Schessen would never be home again. “I’m sure you understand. These foods are my only link back to that land. I’d like for all of this to blow over with no one the wiser.”

The sprite drew farther back among the embers. A coal cracked, its insides flaring bright. From outside, the merchant’s smooth voice filtered to the back of the stall: “Several varieties of seaweed, in fact! You’ll find nothing fresher east of the Silver Mountains.”

Gelan hadn’t eaten seaweed in even longer than pickled cucumbers.

The sprite glanced toward the front of the stall, then turned a circle, kicking up sparks. “Fine. Do you need to sample all the goods?”
