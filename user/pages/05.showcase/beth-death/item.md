### Query

BETH DEATH––a YA Mystery with an LGBTQ enemies-to-lovers romance, complete at 75,000 words––features a teen _Ghost Whisperer_ with the feisty character of Netflix’s _Wednesday_.

For a 16-year-old, high school sucks. Having a mortician as a stepdad—double sucks. A corpse talking to you—total suck-dom with cherries on top.

To escape the bullies, Beth embraces a goth persona. After all, a solitary life is better than tolerating popular girls like annoyingly gorgeous Jessica and her stuck-up sister, Freya.

When the Queen Bee graces the steel slab in their funeral home, Beth gets the shock of her life: Freya’s corpse demands help. Obey the bully who nicknamed her Beth Death? No freaking way.

Only Freya’s death is suspicious, and her sister might be next. Beth partners with Jessica to solve the mystery. When Jessica stirs feelings in Beth, the loner questions her lifestyle. Worried Jessica might reject her in favor of the cool kids, Beth is reluctant to open her heart. To have a chance at love, and save Jessica’s life, she’ll have to do more than that. She’ll have to embrace her persona. Even if it means working with the ghost-of-the-bitch she told to drop dead.

BETH DEATH is a standalone novel with series potential. It was inspired by a murder trial I prosecuted in my former career as a barrister. 

This manuscript made the finals list of the Page Turner Awards and was a finalist for #RevPit 2023. The pitch for BETH DEATH won SCWBI’s Annual Conference pitching competition. I teach secondary school part time, and write, direct and act in murder mystery events. I have YA-aged children, including a 16-year-old daughter who is LGBTQ+. I wanted her to be represented in YA literature and she has read it for authenticity and loved seeing herself in a story.
 
Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.


### First Five Pages

You know that feeling you get when someone’s watching you, but you can’t see them? The hairs on the back of my neck prickle as I make my slap-dash attempt at a turkey sandwich.

Mum’s upstairs and Dad’s at work. I shake my head. There’s no one here. I guess that’s what you get when you secretly watch an 18+ horror movie when you’re twelve. Still, I slide the butter knife off the counter as slow and quiet as possible. This is ridiculous. There’s no psycho serial killer behind me. Besides, this has got to be the bluntest knife in the world. I’m barely even five feet tall—and that’s including my thick soled DMs. What do I think I’m going to do? Butter them to death? 

I whip around. The knife falls limp in my hand as I breathe a sigh of relief. “Dad? I thought you left for work like, an hour ago.”

Sunlight streams in through the window behind him, giving him an almost fuzzy look, like his lines aren’t sharp enough to hold everything in place. It must be the glint in my eyes.

“Beth,” he says quietly. He’s dressed for work in his shiny black loafers and crisp white shirt. He’s wearing the gaudy blue and yellow pineapple tie Mum gave him for Christmas last year and his head is tilted to the side, staring at me.

He looks the same as usual. Why do I feel like this _isn’t_ normal then? Like something super weird is happening. It’s got to be the strange light. It’s messing with my eyes, and that’s messing with the rest of me.

“What’s wrong, dad?” I put the knife back and place my free hand on my hip. “You only look at me like that when something’s wrong.”

It’s true. Out of both of my parents, Dad’s the one who breaks out the _we need to talk_ conversations. I’ve got all his looks cataloged and memorized. This is absolutely the look he pulls out when he’s super upset over something and doesn’t know how to bring it up. Like when the neighbors ran over my cat when I was eight after she got out by accident.

“I just wanted to make sure you know I will always love you,” Dad whispers. Which is mega weird. A slight tingle tiptoes down my spine, and I let out a heavy breath. He gives me a smile, but there’s no true light in it. 

“I know I’ve got that Maths test tomorrow, but these are kind of big theatrics, don’t you think?” This is the weirdest talk I’ve ever got from him. “I probably won’t even fail it. I actually studied this time.”

Another chill crystallizes in my backbone. I gaze at my sandwich, which is not looking anywhere near as tasty as it had before Dad showed up. In fact, I’m pretty sure I couldn’t get it down now even if I tried. It would just turn into a wad of clay in my dry throat and get stuck there.

I turn back to Dad, but he’s gone.

“Dad?” I frown.

I hear a car’s engine in the driveway.  I guess he left for work. Huh. He didn’t even say goodbye. I run to the window and press my face against the glass. It’s a pretty, summer day. His car isn’t anywhere to be seen . . .  But a different car has pulled onto the gravel drive.

A police car!

“Mum,” I call out, “The police are here!”

Mum comes out of the bedroom. “What are you talking about, Beth?”

Someone knocks on the front door. I point towards it. “The police are here, Mum.”

She purses her lips and moves towards the door, pausing with her palm to the handle. Mum takes a deep breath and pulls the door open. “Can I help you?”

The man on the other side is short and squat, with a thick beard and heavy dark sunglasses on. He pulls the sunglasses off, and he puts them in the front pocket of his blue uniform shirt.

“Miss,” he says. “I’m sorry. There’s been an accident.”

My gut plummets to the floor. _Dad_.
  
_Four Years Later_
 
“What are you staring at, ‘Beth Death’?”

Freya flips her perfectly smooth blonde mane like the ass she is. She’s Jessica’s older sister. They’re both super pretty––okay, Jessica is beyond ultra-pretty––but that doesn’t change the fact that they’re also both super ultra-jerks.  

I continue to stare, like a rabbit trapped in headlights. My lips might even be hanging a little bit open. It’s hard to tell. I will say this: I was absolutely not staring at Freya until she spoke to me. Now, I’m caught in that same siren spell everyone else always seems to fall into around her.

“I’m sorry, I’m not into girls,” Freya continues, “especially someone all black-and-white like a living Instagram filter. And neither is my sister, so you can stop that daydream. She wouldn’t give someone like you the time of day.”

Well, maybe not the _same_ siren spell as everyone else. They’re all wrapped up in how pretty and popular Freya is. It’s the kind of spell where you can’t believe something is happening. Like a train about to crash, and you know it’s about to hit the wall, but you just can’t bring yourself to turn away.

“I think it must be mandatory for their weird family,” says her equally annoying, Barbie-wannabe buddy, Lucy. “Dress like a corpse and maybe it’ll get your dad’s attention.”
Her cronies all snigger, like some weird cult with perfect blonde hair and pink manicured nails. Their giggles fill the air like a fork scratching a plate. My eyes dart around the hallway. Luckily, it’s the end of the day, and most kids have gone back to their boarding rooms. 

One of the other girls nods eagerly. “You’re so totally right, Lucy. No one would dress like that willingly. Daddy issues.”

Anger surges through me. It’s this hot flash that builds up in the back of my chest and shoots straight through my fingers, a harsh cutting wave of heat. There’s no quicker way to absolutely make me lose my cool than bringing up my family.

For one, he is NOT my dad, and for two, Freya and her sister Jessica may be the prettiest girls in the school, but they are certainly NOT my type. Under their superficial beauty there’s nothing beneath. I’ve got no idea why everyone at this school is always climbing all over them. Just because they’ve got nice hair, that doesn’t make them goddesses or anything.

I bet if you cut open their skulls there would be just pink fluff inside. Totally useless, completely uninteresting, and really irritating. The kind of pink fluff with glitter that gets absolutely everywhere and on everything.

God, living next to a funeral home is making me way too morbid.

Lucy says, “You’re totally right, Freya. I think she was staring at your ass!”

The other girl snickers, pressing a hand to her mouth. “Creepy. Who knows what she would do to a person!”

My head is about to boil; steam is practically coming out of my ears. The smart thing to do would be to hold my tongue and go the other way, but it’s hard to be smart when you’re brain dead after a boring day at school. Plus, she’s literally right there, staring at me. My tongue is loose. My temper is hot. I can feel the words slowly breaking free.

And…

Here…

They…

Come...

“I wouldn’t want you. You’re like the end pieces of a loaf of bread. Everyone’s touched you, but nobody wants you. And I was staring at you because I was trying to imagine you with a personality.”

I seriously, one hundred percent, had not been staring at her. Okay, I might find myself staring at her sister a bit too much in class. But _not_ Freya.
