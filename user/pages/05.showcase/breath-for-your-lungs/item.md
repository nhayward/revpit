### Query

_CW: childbirth, disordered eating, gun violence, hospitalization, medical gaslighting, racism_

Dear Agent,

Set against the backdrop of America’s maternal mortality crisis, BREATH FOR YOUR LUNGS follows a pregnant, Black healthcare executive who is medically gaslit after giving birth. Told in a dual timeline, my novel (94,000 words) blends the reality of raising Black boys found in the film _American Son_ with the interracial relationships and social injustices of _We Are Not Like Them_ (Christine Pride and Jo Piazza).

In 2007, Magnolia Desriveaux-Winslow abandoned her prestigious pre-med program at Middlewood, a predominantly white New England college, after she landed in the hospital. The school physician told her Black girls couldn’t have a white girl’s disease, and even if they could, she wasn’t thin enough to be in danger. Magnolia was convinced her illness existed only in her mind until her esophagus ruptured.

Thirteen years later, with her Harvard PhD and married to a white MD, she has returned to the college town to build her family and the new healthcare career her recovery drove her toward. But when a Black man is gunned down in the suburbs, she mourns the birth of her healthy newborn son and agonizes if he’ll be next. After doctors dismiss her life-threatening complication as nothing more than typical postpartum changes, Magnolia must use her hospital position to convince them to run tests, or she’ll become a casualty of the system she dedicated her life to repairing.

Longlisted for the 2022 Disquiet Prize, my book draws on my own medical gaslighting experiences and decade-long public health work advancing health equity efforts. When not wordsmithing new realities, I can be found adding vintage charm to my New England home, where I live with my husband and five young children.

I would be delighted to send you the full manuscript! Thank you for your time and consideration.

### First Five Pages

_MAY 7, 2020_

Often alone at night, Magnolia had learned to overcome her fear of shadows. She never denied the fear’s existence, like the voice that used to crowd her thoughts, but instead, rationalized that a craven held nothing to be scared of. Yet as the rain drummed against the slate roof, she stood transfixed near her balcony, tracking the pink of her daughters’ chalk body tracings as they bled down the road where a shadow loomed.

She wondered if the shadow had been cast by the lightning or had always been there when thunder shattered the air and her eyes locked with the leering ones of a young man.

Striking her palms against the glass, Magnolia moved her head from one side of the windowpane’s grid to the other. Her heartbeat quickened as the figure ran from the tiger statues flanking the driveway, faster and faster toward her. But as the baby jabbed in her ribs, she considered that no, she had not seen the face of the Black man shot and killed in the suburbs.

Hearing the voice of her therapist reminding her to get more sleep, she ran her hand in circles on her pregnant belly while the apparition faded into the night.

With the rain intensifying into a bullet shower, she shuffled her feet to the nearby armchair. She sat and dialed the last contact in her phone, her legs bouncing against the velvet as she waited for her college best friend to answer.

“It’s all too much,” Magnolia said as soon as Victoria’s face filled her screen, her puffy eyes indicating Victoria had been crying.

Magnolia didn’t have to ask the one person who could grasp her disorienting fear if she’d seen the news. Two days had passed since the video had been leaked, but there’d been no escaping the trauma porn resurfacing like poisoned apples bobbing in a sea of information that disturbed more than it informed.

Magnolia propped her phone up on the tufted bench at the foot of her bed, and for a while, the two friends sunk in the grave howls of the night. As Magnolia folded week-old laundry, she watched as Victoria toned her canvas, burnt umber swallowing the stark white of a painting coming to life, until she laid her brush down.

“My first sigh of relief was when the doctor put them in my arms. Then again when they passed through the SIDS phase. And then when they could chew and swallow.” Victoria threw her paint-coated hands on top of her head, making enemies of her wrists as she grasped them. “I used to say to myself that the bigger my boys got, the safer they were. But what happened to Ahmaud reminds us that the truth for Black boys is the bigger they get, the more they’re at risk.”

Magnolia’s eyes skirted with tears. Through clear liquid veils, she watched Victoria’s gaze drift to the floor of her home’s studio, where she sat in darkness made inviting by the glint of candlelight.

“This week is the second time I’ve cried because God gave me boys.”

Magnolia couldn’t close her eyes and surrender to the absence of light that replayed the images of Ahmaud Arbery jogging during his last moments. But keeping her eyes open invited the tragedy to transform into a personal terror.

“Oh, I see you, friend,” Victoria said. “Lord knows how tired we are; how there is nothing left to say. Like we’re running out of breath reminding people that we matter.” Her words dragged out as though clutched by the collective weight of fear and grief she and Magnolia shared.

With fresh rivers trailing down her cheeks, Victoria continued, sharing that she’d given her four-year-old sons The Talk. Magnolia opened her mouth to let whatever was building up inside of her escape, but the words gripped her vocal cords.

“Breath for your lungs, sis.” Victoria pulled her romper away from her neck and sighed. “I know experience has taught you this, but our breath is an act of defiance in a country trying so hard to drown it out.”

Magnolia traced her fingers along the thick, raised scar between her breasts before resting her hand over her heart. Time went on, marked by the dwindling flames and glowing embers in Magnolia’s fireplace, until she couldn’t keep her thoughts in any longer.

“I could find out. The baby’s sex. _I_ could find out, right?” Magnolia put the shirtdress she was in mid-fold down on her baby bump. For all of her building fears, learning if she should start preparing for the possibility of one day seeing her child’s name preceded by a hashtag could assuage them.

“You could, yes.”

Attempting to interpret the pause in Victoria’s response, Magnolia pushed on the chair’s armrests and sat up straighter. “All I mean is, it was Bennett’s suggestion to not find out.”

After an emergency at the hospital forced Bennett to miss Magnolia’s twenty-week anatomy scan, the ultrasound tech sealed the result in an envelope for Magnolia to open later with him. But at home, Bennett had casually offered to wait until the birth, and she’d agreed. So the envelope lived in the dark void of Magnolia’s nightstand for the past fifteen weeks.

“Why are you trying to convince me?”

Magnolia considered the answer to Victoria’s question as she raked at the unease building in her chest.

Off the call, she pushed down the cold handles of the French doors and stepped out into the rain. Gripping the wet railing, she took a deep breath and held it in, allowing the coolness of the air to reach the borders of her lungs before breathing out. The collision of her senses was everything she needed to ground herself—the reality of Ahmaud’s mother, Wanda, was not her own.

Like a match, the colors of a healing bruise struck the sky. Magnolia gathered the soaked hem of her robe and waddled back into the warmth of her room before a sudden gust of wind collided with the open doors, slamming them shut. She whipped her head around with a gasp.

Even though she knew claps of thunder always followed lightning, she flinched at the crackle and then the sound coming in through the baby monitor, where Rosie’s cries crystallized as a light show. She stared as the colors faded between monochromatic shades of purple and then black. The crying had resolved, and yet, Magnolia found her slippers with the extinguishing light from her room’s fireplace guiding her path. Climbing down a few steps, she headed left down the corridor and arrived at her daughters’ shared room.

Through the lumps of the blanket, Magnolia’s mind made it look like Rosie was lying sideways. But as her eyes drew to the pillow, she pushed past the door’s creaks.

“Rosie!”

She sprinted across the hollow floorboards to the side of her three-year-old’s bed. Yanking the covers and pillow onto the floor, she ran her hand along the warm sheets. Empty. She fell to her knees to look underneath the bed’s open space, feeling nothing but her too-big baseball cap and a wrinkled doctor’s coat. Rosie always stayed put during thunderstorms as a matter of her own “I coffins” principle. But her mispronounced confidence must have run away.

With labored breaths, Magnolia pivoted her body and called out again, this time loud enough to be heard above the echoing thunder. “Rosalie!”

“Mom?”

Magnolia turned around to the opposite side of the room where her five-year-old lifted her head from her pillow, her left arm a crescent moon of protection above her sister’s crown of curls beside her. Lillian’s other hand clutched her matted stuffed tiger with its lost tail.

Magnolia peered closer and saw that their eyes were still closed. “Shh. Yes, it’s me,” she comforted in a voice much lower than the one she’d released her fears in. “Sorry I woke you up.”

She straightened the covers as Lillian mouthed, “She’s here. She’s okay.”

Resettling Lillian, Magnolia kissed her girls, then inched backward, not wanting to lose sight of either of them again. She let the water pool from her eyes as she rested the side of her head on the door. What her mind and body had endured over the years to survive and bring them into the world often moved her to tears, but watching her girls sleep easily staved them off.

Once her heart had returned to its normal rhythm, she walked across the hallway into the empty nursery. With one hand pressing into the small of her back, she used the other to trace the braided edges of the upholstered crib where the mattress sheet scenes of watercolor birds taking flight calmed her. As light from the hallway seeped into the room, it created shadows that filled the crib. She ran her hand over the sheets, and for a moment, the gray silhouettes disappeared.

Magnolia shook her slipper off by the crib’s feet and rubbed her toe against the acanthus leaf details. She’d always known of the plant to symbolize enduring life. How it had long ago been used to decorate the crown of a queen. Now, she held onto the leaf’s power to safeguard the unborn life still protected in her womb; prayed that if she gave birth to a boy, external harm would never reach him earthside while also longing for the prayer to never be needed.
