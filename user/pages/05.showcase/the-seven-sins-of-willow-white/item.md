### Query

The romantic tension in _Kingdom of the Cursed_ meets the humour of _A Witch's Guide to Fake Dating a Demon_ in THE SEVEN SINS OF WILLOW WHITE, a 90,000 word adult fantasy where a woman makes a deal with the Devil to escape a hell dimension on the brink of collapse—only to fall for him instead. 

Willow White is dead. 

She’s annoyed about it. At twenty-one, she was supposed to be turning into a responsible adult, not proving her family right when they called her a failure. Now, thanks to one tiny (if fatal) mishap, she’s landed in a dimension named Asphodel that looks suspiciously like hell. It’s her biggest failure. Determined to redeem herself, she makes a deal with Asphodel’s ruler, Sath: complete seven tasks, resist seven sins, and he’ll let her go.

But when Sath is sin itself, temptation may be hard to resist. 

Unlike the animalistic demons that reside alongside Willow, Sath is painfully human and unfairly attractive. Not that she’s noticed. As the two work together, he confesses that Asphodel isn’t really hell, but a middle ground. Or, it should be. He’s losing his powers and the demons are plotting against him, desperate to open a set of gates that will allow the worst of their kind to be unleashed.

If Willow can’t complete the tasks in time, her afterlife will be a cycle of endless violence. But the longer she spends in Asphodel, the less she wants to abandon the dead—or Sath—to an eternity of torment. As the demons get closer to breaking free, she’ll have to choose: finish the tasks and complete her transformation into responsible-Willow, or stay and help Sath stop the demons for good—even if it means admitting she belonged in Asphodel all along. 

I live in Wales and like to write books with big twists and even bigger feelings. When I’m not writing, I can be found visiting zoos trying to meet as many animals as possible (past accomplishments include hugging a five foot alligator). 

### First Five Pages

CHAPTER ONE

There’s a five-minute window, in between living and dying, I can’t quite recall.

I remember the beach. I remember so much alcohol running down my throat I snorted some out my nose. People laughed at me. Noah, of course, was annoyed by my behaviour, so I stormed off. Climbed the winding, steep, path to the top of the cliff, Sasha’s hand in mine. We were giggling, shouting obscenities and feeling completely, utterly, invincible. Free. I remember Sasha daring me to jump, telling me it wasn’t that high, that people do this all the time.

I remember Sasha screaming.

What I don’t recall is my own fall. Maybe a brief moment, right at the start, where it felt like flying, the wind poker-hot against my ears as it whistled past my head.

Ending up in this strange limbo doesn’t imply a successful landing. 
Although my heart still beats a slow, steady rhythm, one that matches the rise and fall of my chest, it doesn’t feel the same. It’s a habit, purely mechanical, no blood rushing through my veins or air filling my lungs. I hold my breath for practise. It’s fun for the first few minutes, but then I kind of miss breathing, so I suck in a mouthful of nothing in case it does enough to kick-start the rest of me back to life.

It doesn’t. If anything, I keep getting paler.

That can’t be a good sign.

This is what I get for taking Sasha’s dare. I clutch the ripped ends of my dress, balling the fabric between my fists, wanting to tear it off. It smells like sun cream and vodka and regret. That trip to the beach was supposed to be one last hurrah, my final chance to let bad-decision-Willow make an appearance before I became responsible-Willow forever. The job application destined to change my life was already filled out.

And I fucked it. I utterly fucked it.

All bad-decision-Willow had to do was _not get herself killed_, and she couldn’t manage that much.

There has to be a way out of this. I’m not in any pain; that must count for something. Maybe my injuries weren’t that bad, and my body is being worked on by doctors right now. All I need to do is find a way back to it, and I’ll wake like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, all shiny and new and ready to hit send on that damn email.

Something scuffles up ahead.

My heart—my utterly useless heart—flips in my chest. “Hello?”

Nothing answers. The scuffling continues.

“Hello?” I risk a step forward, my feet slapping against damp stone. “Is someone there?”

Please be someone nice. A medical professional would be ideal.

There’s a hiss of a match being struck, and a light shines in the distance. I move towards that beacon like a ship heading to a lighthouse, if the ship was both confused and kind of stressed about what it might find at the end of the sea. 

The matchlighter shuffles close enough for me to see its face. 

A whimper escapes my throat. 

Oh, fuck. Oh _fuck_. I stumble back, desperate to get away, I _have_ to get away—I slip, algae sending my foot flying out from under me. My tailbone cracks against stone and—fuck. That hurt. And I felt it.

So the whole not-feeling-pain thing lasted all of five minutes. Well, isn’t that wonderful? Isn’t that swell? There are zero upsides to being here, and there’s a demon standing in front of me.

I don’t know what else to call it. Although it’s standing on two legs, its features are almost fox-like, with clever eyes and a long snout for a nose. Instead of fur, it’s covered in a leathery red skin the colour of sealing wax on an ancient envelope. Little puffs of smoke emit from its nostrils, causing the candle in its paw to flicker wildly.

This can’t be happening. This isn’t a waiting room. There isn’t a doctor trying to save my life. I’m dead. I’m dead, and I’m in...

“I don’t understand,” I whisper.

But I do.

Because unless the world has got things very, very, backwards, creatures like this don’t exist any place good.

No. _No_. I press a shaking hand to my mouth. This isn’t right. Not even bad-decision-Willow deserves this. This is wrong. All wrong.

There has clearly been some kind of administration error.

Well. They’re just going to have to fix it.

I straighten, dropping my hands to my sides and forcing myself to look the demon in the eye. Mum always said I should be more like her, and she wouldn’t stand for a mistake of this magnitude. Mimicking her very best customer-complaint-voice, I say, “I need to speak to a manager. I’m not supposed to be here.”

It’s a pity my imitation skills have never been up to scratch.

The demon stares at me, unblinking. I’m not sure if it speaks English, but I need it to listen. My ankle throbs. The back of my head feels like it’s been split open. The longer I’m here, the more solid everything seems.

I swallow a fresh wave of panic. Maybe, right at the beginning, that had been my window for escape, but I was too busy chastising myself for succumbing to Sasha’s bright idea and delighting over the fact I couldn’t feel pain, focusing on the trivial instead of the important.

And now I’ve lost the chance to focus on it at all. I’ve lost my chance to do _everything_.

“Are you listening?” My voice shakes this time. “I have to leave.”

The demon waves a paw, beckoning me to follow. It’s shown no sign it’s sympathetic to my plight, so I doubt it plans on leading me anywhere I want to go.

But if this demon won’t listen to me, I’ll find someone who will.

My legs aren’t inclined to agree with my brain on this one, wobbling like jelly as I clamber upright. The demon huffs. Rude. I’m trying my best, despite the algae situation. Would shoes be out of the question? I was wearing an excellent pair of sandals when I died.

I echo the demon’s huff, just to let it know that I’m as dissatisfied by this arrangement as it is, before taking several, unsteady, steps and following it into the unknown.

CHAPTER TWO

The demon leads me out of the darkness into a cavern lit with sconces that flicker in a phantom wind. The walls are damp, rivulets of water trickling through cracks in emerald stone. Moss sprouts from various orifices. There’s enough light for me to take in the large body of water filling three quarters of the cave—around the size of a football pitch—so dark it’s almost black, like an oil spill.

On the water is a Viking ship, with an elongated prow that ends with a snake’s head carved into the wood. A figure cloaked in black stands to the side of the sail, a skeletal hand appearing from its sleeve and crooking a finger.

I can’t imagine that thing will listen to what I have to say either.

My feet trip over themselves as they try to go backwards and forwards at once. I don’t want to go to the oarsman. I don’t want to go back to the dark room.

I’m only twenty-one; I don’t want to be dead at all.

Tears sting my eyes as the demon forces me across a line that shimmers on the ground. Immediately, the cavern brightens, revealing it’s not just me heading for that boat. Not by a long shot. There’s a cluster of presumably-dead humans standing on a rocky shore, each with a demon companion of their own.

Some have that same red, leathery skin of my fox friend, while others possess reptilian scales in a myriad of blues and greens. Others look closer to human. The one nearest to me sports a human body paired with a lion’s mane and a tail made of bone.

My demon is tiny in comparison to the rest, like they decided I’d be unlikely to cause trouble and gave me the runt of the litter. Fine with me.

It’ll make it easier to break free.
