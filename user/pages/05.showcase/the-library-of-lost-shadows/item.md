### Query

I’m seeking representation for THE LIBRARY OF LOST SHADOWS, an adult urban fantasy that is BOOK OF NIGHT’s sardonic main characters, meets the gothic vibes and the power of words in THE BOOK EATERS with the diverse representation and criminal tendencies of PORTRAIT OF A THIEF. It is complete at 97,000 words and was written as a standalone, though it has duology potential. Editors from Atria books and Flatiron have requested to see the completed manuscript once I have representation, and this manuscript was shortlisted for the J J Bola Emerging Writers Prize.

Ada is a confident bisexual art forger and thief. At least, that's the image she projects. Really, she's haunted by an event that’s halted her thieving career in its tracks and left her with an aversion to touch, a hatred of painting and a love of self-sabotage. All in all, when her boss gets fed up with her subsiding on his alcohol and demands she finally pay her debt, Ada knows she shouldn’t be surprised. 

Ivy. a London journalist, struggles to keep up with her high-pressure career whilst experiencing chronic pain and obsessively digging into her sister's disappearance a year ago. Unable to resist following any thread that might prove she’s still alive, bridges are starting to burn with not only her career, but friends, family, and even her sanity. 

An invitation to a whimsical, lavishly hypnotic party at a mysterious library draws them together — a place where escapism is encouraged, and a mysterious man known only as The Collector may be able to rewrite the past for a pretty penny. This is Ivy’s last chance to find out what happened to her sister’s tale, if she can convince Ada to help instead of thieving. With the library’s capricious nature leading them where it chooses, they find that the other may be all they have to cling to. But neither know that they’re following the Collector’s perfect script. Here, words work for him. 

A freelance arts and books journalist, I have worked with publications including _The Bookseller_, _The Grammys_ and _The Independent_. I also edit and proofread magazines and manuscripts, including working with Simon & Schuster. My manuscript is inspired by my desire to portray disabled women with chronic illness and neurodivergence in all their complexities, reflecting my own identities. It also features a sapphic romance with representation of the ace spectrum and bisexuality.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

**PART ONE - The Check In **

_“The thing about a library is that it can occupy any space; it is the book borrowed from a friend, the large study space in a skyscraper, it is the knowledge of a wise old woman, and the whispered retelling of a tale to a stranger you’ve recently become acquainted with through tripping on their shoelaces. Borrowed, altered, revered. _

_This library collection is particularly special. One of the best in the world. It can see the stories tucked up inside of you, pressed into wafer-thin candied petals right by your heart — ones you’ve desperately tried to preserve…or dissociate from. At the back of the library is a simple mirror which, if you pass it, leads to a not-so-simple maze of books, novels, scraps of paper with love letters on them; songs weave the corridor’s tiles and paint leaks new legends out of old poems. They’re catalogued, of course, like any good library. They have more knowledge tucked into a shadowy corner than many can expect in their lifetime. The Collector is there to make sure of that._

_And the library will not let you out until she has heard the ending. Until she has borrowed the empire of words you never realised you had.” _

_-	An Interview with a Chronicler, ‘Musings On Love, Loss and the Merits of a Catalog Card’_

**Chapter 1**

_**ADA**_

London started and ended with money. This was a fact Adaline Murray had known her whole life, had cherished it as gospel. The city possessed neither love nor hate for you. It wouldn’t stop time for your fears, hopes, or dreams, but always maintained a calm indifference. What it wanted was capital. If you had it, great. If you didn’t—well, get some. Ada had always chosen to see opportunity in her city’s detachment. In detachment, overall, quite frankly.

She slipped the wallet into her coat pocket alongside the other jewellery and trinkets stolen this morning, nimbly threading her way through the crowded street — a pointed needle bearing a pained smile. She was only doing what the city demanded. You always knew where you stood with London. Her colours were true, even if her people were not.

Even if one of her citizens was watching you. And someone was definitely watching her.

Ada’s eyes zeroed in on the corner ahead as she weaved herself through the flurry of people. She never settled, ignoring the target she felt firmly painted on her back. Robotically, Ada brushed her calloused hands against the soft, leather skin of the wallet. Before, she had almost admired the aloof distance her city maintained. Didn’t it give the independence she craved? But now, she had added another fact to her knowledge sphere: independence could sometimes look a lot like loneliness. 

It had been two weeks since her latest fling had stopped answering calls, texts, emails, and it was her mother’s birthday, but Ada was numb to all of it these days. She always expected the world would be tilted on its axis whenever she stepped outside to her old haunts, with a haze over the City of London like a spider had weaved sugar over and under the landmarks, the people...Sickly sweet dust settling on a dash she had once propped her feet up on in arrogance, whilst she could do anything but. 
 
Instead, everything was - give or take - the absolute fucking same. 
 
She focused on the next corner, and then the next, so the jostles – the accidental _I’m-so-sorry-but-actually-you-were-in-my-way_ shoulder brushes – couldn’t harm her. The last thing she needed was the icy sweat of panic to drip down her neck, black-stained vision sending her to the floor, the scent of oranges stinging kisses along her collarbone. 

A thief was hardly any use if they couldn’t stand touching others. 

Fao didn’t need to say it, Ada knew why she had been given this small task, especially on her mother’s birthday. He always did like to remind her that she had been abandoned, and he had saved her from the various debts her mother had left behind. _Cruel_. She was an art forger, a thief — highly trained in spotting the difference between an _Eric Hebborn_ and a _Corot_ — it was insulting that eyes pierced her back, watching for any sign of distress. He had set someone to watch her. A punishment; one of the strangest kinds, framed so carefully as help; Fao liked to tread the line. A boss when he didn’t want to be too close, an uncle when he wanted her trust. She had been under careful watch since her frequent outbursts of “mental instability” had started to mess with the intricate nature of carefully studying, replicating, and swapping out priceless paintings. Ada found the term insulting, she considered herself saner than half the people that surrounded her, stuck in the rat race. Still, her hands shook like traitors, playing for the other team. 

Faolan had sent kind eyes today, Ada noted as she looked behind her in a shop’s reflection. _I’ve sunk so low he doesn’t even send real bodyguards_. Theo, her erstwhile colleague and sometimes friend, was hardly a match for the usual silent types Fao sent to accompany her, but there was less money around to pay them now, she supposed. Efficiency was key when you were part of Faolan’s team, but he was probably just happy to settle for her experiencing daylight for the first time in a week. The honey-dripped autumn day promised to stretch long, unreasonably warm air begging Ada to shed her plaid button-up. The old shirt she had borrowed had a musty smell percolating its very own radius, mingling with the pungent brake dust and rain-soaked brick combination of Covent Garden that wasn’t entirely unpleasant after months spent inside. Statistically, it was a perfect day for pickpocketing, with people feeling light, breezy…forgetful. Ada hadn’t took to petty thievery in years, but there was something prophetic about today, an energy she might have wanted to capture, if she were currently touching the paints shoved underneath her bed.

Ada ignored the weight of her worries with a shrug, her muscles tense from the multitude of cars speeding past at break-neck speed. _Focus_. Her pocket crinkled with every movement. The invitation to a cosy, unremarkable library on the west side of town branded her pocket next to the stolen wallet, weighing down her left side. The elegant black ink burned the inside of her irises every time she tried to sleep for the last week. The piece of paper was nothing, really, just a party invite. In the library her mother used to revere. Now that she was a roaming nomad, Ada was left to deal with the invites instead. Fao always called his sister childish. Obsessed with pageantry and splendor and magic, as if she could just escape their circumstances. Of course, the drugs might have had something to do with her seeing magic where there was none. 

Ada had memories of the library, but they were edged with a shiny film, as if she had been submerged underwater. It irritated her that, after all these years, she still couldn’t scrounge up _only_ hatred. Anger was commonplace in Ada’s life yet thinking of her mother at all always came with a distinct mixture of guilt, shame, and…something else. She remembered the way her perfume smelled. It was enough leftover affection that she still kept the invites, though they were getting less extravagant with every year. They were always handwritten, which Ada had found strange. At first they were all sealed with a black wax stamp on a creamy, thick envelope, but this year it had been forgotten. Who wouldn’t send a party invite electronically these days? It was almost embarrassing. Out of touch. What was more confusing was the fact it had been translated into several different languages. Why handwrite an invite — a personal affair, Ada concluded — and then translate it into different languages, as if you have no idea who might read it? The handwriting was so slanted and cursive this year, as if written in a maddened haste, all her translation apps had turned up dust, but she had read enough of them to gather the gist was the same, year upon year: 

_“Escapism is often a trick of the light in this city. We toss and turn with our glass-doll wounds until the shadows speak back. Until they tell us that our self-made cages are not our own fault. Until they tell us they are. If you have something you’re running from, run here, to the old library on Carnival Lane at nine minutes past nine. Fate can change…and that memory can be forgotten. For a price.”_

Ada had never wanted to forget. Knowing…had powered her through, in a strange way. Knowing that society didn’t care for people like her, with no qualifications, no escape, no trust-fund, it allowed her to accept things. Nothing she could do would make her worthy to them, and there was a freedom in that. It was worse to think that now, instead of being invisible, she might be seen as pitiful. Or worse, strong. Ada hated the way people acted like an assault was the death of a woman, or a turning point of a character arc. It was neither; she was just lost. Unable to find her way back to where she had buried herself. Forgetting would only make that worse, and she wasn’t so sure the root cause could be quantified by a date. Still, on her worst days, it was a comforting fantasy.
