### Query

The Skratti, an ancient shadow-born god who was once human, protects the land from foreign invaders in exchange for human sacrifices that the village Seeress insists the Skratti needs. This ritual _must_ continue if the Skratti wants to regain her humanity. But when the next offering, a former warrior-turned-thief named Rorik, triggers forgotten memories about her childhood, she needs answers, and does something unheard of—she spares Rorik, breaking the ritual cycle and sparking something else.

When a band of Viking crusaders with duplicitous intentions arrive on their shores, the Skratti’s past haunts her with the discovery of a human sister who is now enslaved by their clan leader. The leader vows to kill the dark monster in the woods to bring a new religion to the pagans…but the Skratti is of the old gods, and _she_ vows to save her sister, before upholding her bargain with the Seeress. To help strike the balance between vengeance, rescuing her sister, and regaining her humanity, the Skratti must enlist the help of the man she saved, and is developing feelings for, Rorik.

Together, they learn that the Seeress’ methods have been solidifying the bond between the Skratti and the dark god within, and not severing them like she promised. The Skratti must choose: finish the initial ritual and devour Rorik’s heart, or reject her fate to save his life. Starving the darkness within will doom the village, and her chance at saving her sister, but casting it out may save her soul … and her love. 

BLÓT - HEART EATER is an 80,000-word Norse-inspired dark historical fantasy and is a 2023 #RevPit winner. It combines the seduction of a dark god found in Adalyn Grace’s _Belladonna_, with the monster romance of a gender-bent _Beauty and the Beast_, and a doomsday MC to rival Netflix’s _Wednesday_.

I hold a BA in English from the University of New Mexico with a focus on Creative Writing and Early Medieval Literature and now live in Colorado with my husband and our two furry children. Working as a project manager during the day, I spend my weekends seeking outdoor adventures and catching up on binge-worthy TV.

**Book Content Warning:**

**As a medieval dark fantasy with elements of horror, this book has many depictions of blood and violence. It contains ritualistic animal sacrifice, self-harm, parental death, cannibalism, and suicide. Though these scenes are done with care and inspired by a real ancient culture, they may still trigger some.**

### First Five Pages

Chapter One

Everything comes alive in the seconds before I consume a human heart. My senses sharpen to new levels as the spirit of the forest comes sweeping in—a rogue crow flapping its wings, the rustle of leaves atop an ash tree, the screeching of a dying rabbit. And the rapid thumping of the heart beating inside my offering’s chest.

Saliva dribbles from my lips as my claws dig into this human’s flesh, and I tremble, lightheaded in anticipation of that first taste—that first rush of warm blood bathing my tongue. Thick, sentient shadows swirl in my chest as I inhale an icy breath filled with wood smoke and damp earth. My _home_. The crisp air stirs my senses, clearing the shadows that consume my soul, giving way to the hallowed yearning that brought me here: the need to feed.

Thrashing within my grip, the man yells for help from the village, but help will not come from them. _They_ were the ones who chose this offering, securing him to the post during the blót ceremony earlier this evening. This place is sacred. Situated beyond the protection of their high walls, the ground is a gateway, close enough to the wild forest where the gods will hear their human prayers. Carved stones shape a circle around boot-worn dirt, and behind me, the forest springs up in thick pine, barren canopies, and shadowed doom.

The chanting to signal the start of the ceremony carried on the whispering wind for miles, and I came; the metallic scent of a fresh wound driving me from my cave. I glance at it, the wound. Blood still drips from the human’s bicep. _My_ human. The sacrificial offering to the darkness that lives in the woods. A sacrifice they make to me every moon cycle.

I bend, pressing my face against the space between my meal’s neck and collarbone, inhaling the stench of human sweat. My stomach turns in disgust. _Humans_. I avoid them well—the blót has seen to that—and only make contact when the hunger draws me back; when they have chosen a victim.

The smoky haze that flows through my hair-like tendrils dances across the tanned skin beneath me, and my lips curl as my offering winces against my touch.

“I am nobody. A th-thief. The gods will not accept my sacrifice. I a-am sp-spoiled,” he begs, voice cracking.

_Spoiled_. Does this human man not know that “spoiled” is the reason they chose _him_? 

_Broken. Wicked_. These are the qualities of a good offering. The village casts these humans out, but they are perfect for me. Monsters crave rotten hearts.

“Quiet.” My voice cuts the air in a low hiss, and lingers until night swallows it.

His messy brown hair hangs in greasy strands over a forehead that slopes to protruding cheekbones and a sharp jaw. Mud and dark blood stain his tunic. Shoulder blades jut from his back, and his mid-section is too slim. He is starving. “Spoiled” is an accurate description for this man. Like a decaying corpse.

Crouching over him, I dig my claws into his shoulders, and he shrieks. The seduction of his screams calls to the darkness within, causing the ache in my belly to swell and groan, and I kneel on his torso so he cannot squirm, before licking the blood from my fingertips. My head spins. 

A branch cracks in the distance and my eyes snap to its precise location, senses tuned to the inky black of night. The big eyes of a little girl peeks through the brush, her face pale with fear. She wears a tan smock and a long woollen coat pulled close to her chest, and when my dark eyes meet hers, she cups her plump pink lips, lets out a yelp, and darts away.

The sound of her retreat echoes in the shadows of the forest, and I war against the darkness within; the darkness that begs me to give chase, the darkness that the Seeress and I are working to control, so I might one day regain the last shred of humanity that still exists somewhere deep in my soul. _Give in to temptation a little, or else lose control completely._

The child will live, and the village will buzz about what she saw this night—the dark figure in the woods. The woman who was once human, but no longer. The wraith in possession of sharp claws and phantom hair, with black veins marring ghostly skin. _She still haunts the woods. She is real. We must continue to sacrifice._

The girl’s mother will assure her that she is safe, and her father will stand ready with an axe, keeping a keen watch for any sign that she was followed. She is well protected by her family.

My brow furrows. But, was I? Would my parents have comforted me so? I … I cannot remember.

I take a deep, pained breath as my insides twist, and allow the air to slowly seep through my lips before turning my attention back to my quarry.

I glance down, and hiss into the night. He is gone, the ground where he once lay, bare, a depression of sunken earth and dark blood stains. _Curses!_ Me for losing focus, him for doing something so foolish. I take flight into the thick maze of trees, easily following the sweet, lingering trail of prey on the run. _My_ prey.  

I am upon him in an instant, slamming my body into his weak frame. He topples over, but not before swinging something sharp that digs into my side. Cold liquid spills from me, splattering his face. He spits, still swinging the tree branch, a thief’s borrowed sword, a weak weapon that would not serve as a key to Valhalla. I rip it from his grasp, snap it in half, and toss it to the forest floor before tearing the thin, fraying fabric of his shirt to expose the tender skin of his chest.

_Thump. Thump. Thump_. His heart pounds as I dig my nails deeper into his flesh, reveling in his screams … until an image bursts through my mind—a small boy with messy hair running through tall barley stalks, and another hand, a little girl’s, reaching as she tries to catch him. Another vision, this time the pair sit on thick moss at the base of an ash tree. The little boy picks a white wildflower and hands it to the girl. The dimples in his pudgy cheeks cut into his face, and a blush spreads over the girl’s freckled nose. And then there is something else. I feel it so clearly. The sweet scent of freshly harvested wheat, the lingering tang of fermented turnips—and somehow I know it was pilfered from Mother’s pantry, and that a switch awaited me when I returned home. But it didn’t matter, for I was with _him_.

The images disappear as I shake my head furiously, unclenching my fists and releasing him. 

Heat blooms across my chest, but I am frozen.

He squeezes his eyes shut, grimacing against the pain, but does not scramble away.

“What have you done?” I shriek, vision clouding over as my head swims. 

When he realizes I am no longer poised for attack, he parts his lips. “Why do you not kill me?”

I do not have an answer to his question. Were those memories? Who is this man? What trickery of the gods is this? The questions are too many, leaving only two options: kill him now, or do something I have never done before. And for once, I do not know what to do. 

He glances at me, and our gazes lock together for what seems like eternity … until he tilts his head, ever so slightly to the side. Then, a warning flashes in his eyes and he holds his breath, waiting.

I need to feed, but those images are haunting me, and I cannot allow him to return to the village unharmed. My eyes linger on the dark stains that spread across his tunic and the oozing wounds on his chest. Well, _mostly_ unharmed. 

Stories will spread of the creature’s mercy, and the villagers will think they no longer need to make their sacrifices. That must not happen. Even as I stand here, the hunger stirring inside scrapes my insides raw. I need another sacrifice. Soon.

“I think I must keep you,” I hiss. 

The man’s eyes widen, and he shrinks into himself as if this fate is worse than death to him. 

“Keep you until I kill you, that is,” I add through crimson-stained lips.
