### Query

Illegally keeping her father alive, Elia hates having to siphon magic from his unconscious body to keep the family business open. Most of all, she hates that her key conjuring is useless without his door enchanting magic. But it’s the only way to earn money and secure her siblings’ future. But when a prince offers a fortune for a single commission, Elia’s certain her worries are over. Until he asks her to craft a secret door to a magical library so he can hunt for a scroll to end an endless war. One problem. The library exists in a forbidden country, where there’s a price on Elia’s head.

There’s no way she’ll go back and risk arrest so some prince can find a mythical scroll. But everything changes when the god of death punishes Elia for keeping her father alive. He smites her youngest brother with a curse that’ll kill him, unless she finds a cure…which happens to be located in the same magical library, in the same forbidden country, commissioned by the prince.

To save her brother and buy a future for her other siblings, Elia makes a deal with the prince. But her plans turn to dust when she develops feelings for him, and he unwittingly unleashes an ancient monster hidden within his scroll. It transforms him into a creature forced to end war through annihilation, and Elia must stretch the limits of her magic as she faces an impossible dilemma. Save her cursed younger brother or save the cursed prince who threatens their world.

UNLOCK THE NIGHT is a YA fantasy, complete at 90,000 words. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the atmosphere and magical library of _Sorcery of Thorns_, and _Spin the Dawn’s_ journey-based adventure with reluctant allies-to-lovers romance.

A technical writer by sunlight, and a fantasy writer by moonlight, my short stories have appeared in _Factor Four Magazine, The Colored Lens, Rose Red Review_, and _Three Rivers Review_. This manuscript was a RevPit 2020 winner. I also have a B.A. in Creative Writing.

### First Five Pages

**Chapter 1**

If Elia didn’t convince this cranky witch to give her another batch of elixir, Papa would die tonight. It wasn’t dramatics or anything—no one would ever accuse her of that—but inevitable, awful truth. There were mouths to feed, and keeping him a half-inch from death’s door was the only way to provide for her four younger siblings. And by every god of light and shadow, she’d go home with what she came for.

Elia’s hand gripped the door handle of the hope witch’s shop. She breathed deep and drowned out the bustle of the busy cobbled street. Foot traffic was heavy as people went on their errands beneath the blue-skied mid-afternoon rush, and Elia watched them. She’d rather be anywhere but here.

Because the witch would argue. She always did. It was only a matter of time before she outright denied Elia’s request. But not today. It _wouldn’t_ be today.

Squaring her shoulders, she pushed down the handle, strode forward, and saw stars as she collided with the doorframe. Curse this place to the depths of the afterlife. She’d even ducked…hadn’t she? Pretty sure she had. At three rickety steps below street level, most people had to crouch as they entered. Why the stooped witch had insisted on building everything to accommodate her own diminutive stature was beyond Elia. There were customers to think of, for skies’ sake. Though, Elia was taller than most. But this shop—with its dark-stained thigh-high counters, shelves near her ankles, and pungent hanging herbs that smacked her head whenever she moved—this shop was the worst. Elia rubbed her forehead and groaned into the hazy room. The windows were yellow with layers of grime, admitting only tired, amber sunlight that made Elia squint.

As the door shut behind her, and Elia’s heart pulsed a loud thud-ump. The withered witch looked up from stirring something fragrant and fizzing, her tight silver and onyx ringlets escaping her purple scarf in wisps. The familiar constellations of age spots and freckles on her hands shifted as she guided the enormous ladle from the large, iron pot that hung over the fire before raising one black eyebrow. She didn’t spill a single drop. “You again? So soon?”

Before she could launch into some fresh and fiery lecture, Elia set an empty crimson vial on the counter and put on her best no-nonsense face. No games today. “More elixir, please. Two months’ worth.”

The witch glared at the bottle and shook her head. “I shouldn’t. It’s unethical.”

Elia gritted her teeth. That was rich coming from a hope witch. “So is letting my little brothers and sister starve. Please, Grivya. Remember, it’s what Papa asked for. His last request.”

The witch cleared her throat and shifted her steely glare to Elia. 

“Apologies, _Rinna_-Grivya.” Elia quickly dipped her head with the appropriate respect. She’d forgotten to use Grivya’s honorific. As if there was honor in selling longshot potions and dangerous elixirs to desperate people. Grivya made her living by stoking people’s fear and offering a tiny ray of hope in the face of whatever tragedy sent them to her. 

Grivya lifted the crimson vial to the light and rolled it between her knobby forefinger and warty thumb. She sniffed it before letting out a tired sigh.

“Your father was such a sweet boy. Always so respectful. Your grandfather and I were almost matched, which would have made Carrick _my_ boy. And you’re torturing him.” Her lips tugged into a frown, weighting her wrinkles like dew-drenched cobwebs. 

She said this every time, and it never failed to punch Elia in the gut. Grivya was right, of course. But that didn’t change Elia’s situation. Gods help her. She didn’t _want_ to torture Papa. He deserved a peaceful passage through the gates to the afterlife. To reunite with Mama. But what choice did she have?

“It wasn’t supposed to go on this long, girl.” Grivya stomped a wayward cockroach into the filthy floorboards. “I may not have been his mother, but I was _like_ a mother to him.”

Elia’s stomach twisted in familiar knots as she lowered her gaze to the floor. “I know, Rinna.” 

Elia slid her hand into her apron pocket and fiddled with her heavy key ring. Jeweled keys, bone keys, wood keys, every kind of key her magic could conjure. All useless without her father’s door magic. They had been a great team. He pulled doors from the elements and enchanted them to open in faraway places, and she conjured keys that unlocked doors and pathways to their destinations. But no one would buy her keys without his doors. That’s why she needed him alive. With Grivya’s elixir, Elia could keep Papa on the threshold between life and death while she siphoned his magic.

Why couldn’t she just hand over the elixir without a lecture? She was almost as guilty as Elia. Not that Elia dared to voice that thought aloud. She didn’t even want to imagine how _that_ conversation would go.

Grivya tutted as she removed jars of ingredients from the shelves and grabbed a butcher knife. She hacked at a glowing blue Fightflower. Elia swallowed hard as pieces of the flower flew everywhere, but most of the trumpet petals and dark red thorns piled up at the end of the cutting board. 

“If you’ve paid so much attention, why do you keep asking?” Grivya dumped a bowl of lava newt eyeballs into a small cauldron of boiling oils, and Elia wrinkled her nose. Wood smoke and plant rot. Disgusting. “It’s been over a year, girl. I can’t keep this up so you can earn a wage. Why is it never enough? Why not stop this?”

Because Grivya had promised. Papa’s last request was as good as a dying wish. Grivya agreed to show Elia how to keep his body fastened to the realm of the living so she could siphon his magic to earn a purse. Simple. And then Papa had lost consciousness for the last time, his unbeatable illness trapping him in a place beyond waking. Not quite alive, but not quite dead. 

Elia closed her eyes and exhaled slowly. It was the only way, but what would it cost her? Surely the gods would exact a heavy toll, much more than the income she managed. But she’d be able to stop soon. 

“Just a little longer, I swear. Two more months should do it.” Elia held up her index finger in the sign of a vow. Two months, and she’d be nineteen.

“Humph.” Grivya stirred the mini-cauldron, occasionally sprinkling multi-colored sparks into the solution. They had talked about this last time. And Grivya had criticized the plan then too. “So you’ll pay some middle-skilled matchmaker, become a tradeworker’s wife, and settle your siblings in schools. What then?”

“Whatever else wives do. I’ll survive.” Elia shrugged. It couldn’t possibly be that hard. People were matched every day. “And they’ll be safe. That’s all that matters.”

Grivya harrumphed again as she dropped firebird oil into the potion. Elia jutted her chin. She shouldn’t care that her plans were never enough for Grivya—it’s not like the witch ever offered an alternative—but Elia did care. Sometimes it kept her up at night.

“Your plan is noble, but stupid. You would tie yourself to some partner and give up your craft?” asked Grivya. “Yes, your brothers and sister will be cared for, but what about your magic? What will you do with it when your father passes?”

Grief cut like a hot knife through Elia’s heart. _When your father passes_. When she would finally let him go in peace to the realm of the dead. When she would truly be an orphan. 

Before the burning lump in her throat could rise any further, she swallowed it down. She had mouths to feed, a shop to keep, bills to pay. There was no time to worry about the distant future.

She dropped her keys back in her pocket. “Have you forgotten? My magic begins and ends with Papa’s. When he passes, my craft will be useless. Which is why I need two more months.” 

Elia kissed her palm and raised it to remind the gods of her affection. An ancient, superstitious custom for luck. But a useless one. The gods had never smiled on her. If they had, her mother wouldn’t have died all those years ago, leaving her in charge of raising her brothers and sister. Her father wouldn’t be sick to the edge of death now. Wits and work had seen her through more trouble than luck or the gods ever had. But still, she made the sign…just in case.

“You’re ignoring the depths of your potential.” Grivya shook her head.

Potential. What potential? There was nothing for her once he passed, nothing but the knowledge she’d fulfilled her role and secured her siblings’ futures.

“Maybe,” Elia said. “But my family comes first.” 

And she’d deal with what came next…later.
