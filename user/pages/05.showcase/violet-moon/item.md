### Query

Thou shalt not kill, right? Wrong. It’s the year 3082, and on Violet Moon, sacrificing moon worms is a rite of passage for Eighteens. For, TIMBER, the idea of taking a life in any capacity fills him with dread. Anxiety plagues his every decision, including his career placement within the village.

Regardless of Timber’s lack of training, his indecisiveness lands him in a position partnered with MARS, a headstrong space and time traveler. A gentle moon worm and a fierce flare cat, these two couldn’t be more unevenly matched, but they have to find a way to work together to save a dust planet on the brink of destruction. Timber already failed his Coming of Age ceremony. Another failure could mean annihilation of a planet and Timber’s crew.

VIOLET MOON is an upper YA, sci-fi-adventure standalone with trilogy potential. Complete at 77,000 words, it is _Aurora Rising_ meets _Back to the Future_. I was inspired to write this story as a means to explore generational relationships, the anxieties of growing up as well as my personal experiences with body positivity and demisexuality. I am a #RevPit 2020 winner and currently reside in Maine, holding a Master’s degree in Screenwriting from the New York Film Academy.

CHAPTER ONE

TIMBER—VIOLET MOON 3082

Thou shalt not kill, right?

Wrong. Thou shalt not kill but once in each lifetime. Thou shalt also refer to it as a ceremonial sacrifice, so it sounds justified. The thought of it makes me sick. Morally ill, sure, but I’m talking about the hours I spent restless last night, tossing and turning between sweaty mounds of woven cotton and warped goose-feather pillows. This morning I was paler than a dune snake egg. When I was getting ready just now to join my fellow Eighteens, I dry-heaved so hard into the compost barrel next to our dwelling I think I pulled a neck muscle.

A tightness twinges in my chest. Herbal smoke settles in the air, a blend of juniper and myrrh. The fragrant aroma fills my lungs and burns the back of my throat. _Gods and Goddesses be with me_. We follow along the muddy path that snakes through the thick jungle flora. Domed mountain peaks reveal themselves before us as we near the valley of stone. In the center of a giant stone mosaic, a mandala, sits a ring of fire that radiates a blazing heat.

Our entire village fits around the edge of the circle, huddled together in a sea of colorful tunics and cloaks. We are the Vio and tonight, we honor those of us entering our eighteenth year. And while everyone else has been looking forward to this moment, I’ve been dreading it since we completed our Ceremony of Adolescence in our thirteenth year. That I could handle. Young girls started tracking their moon cycles and young men celebrated their deepened voices.

Nothing like this.

The Coming of Age ceremony is different. Starting tomorrow, my days will no longer be mine. I’ll be contributing to our community like those before me. If only I knew how. I’m drawn to becoming a Healer, but I can’t stomach the act of watching others suffer. _That includes moon worms_. And I’m not made of Watcher stock like Raine. My best friend since adolescence, he’d at least admit my company would be satisfying.

_Timber will end up alone in the Dunes_, my father once said. Not referring to the Dunes’ mechanism sector where he works. He’s talking about the mines, where the confused dig for crystal until they find their true calling. Though most never do.

My eternal fate.

And I mean that.

The other Eighteens close in around me. Ceremony slacks that fit better than mine. Flowing, bell-sleeved dresses that whip me in the face as they flit by excitedly. A few offer smiles, but I wonder what they really think of me.

_Oh, you know, there’s Timber having his regularly scheduled panic attack._

It’s fine. I’m fine.

“Why do you always look like you’re being tortured?” Edith teases, coming up beside me. Her soft brown skin catches the flickering glow ahead of us through the vines and tilted trees. She wears a burgundy, one-shouldered dress that compliments the hints of gold in her umber eyes. As she stands before me now, I forget that she is my younger sister Marlowe’s truest friend. Edith shines, a confident woman who has grown into herself and accepted her adulthood.

“I didn’t realize I was—”

“It’s written all over your face, Timber.” She pinches my cheeks and worry swells inside me like a ravenous beast. “Don’t be nervous. All Eighteens complete their Coming of Age ceremony. Just choose a moon worm with no fat and your blade will cut right through.”

She pats me on the back and skips ahead, a swirl of thick smoke swallowing her whole. My toes curl in the damp soil at my feet. A heaviness settles in my chest. _Why did she have to say it like that?_ I step off to the side and allow all the other Eighteens to pass. Once I’m alone, I steady myself against a tall, jagged stone pillar at the mouth of the trail. _Deep breaths_. Two minutes. That’s how much time went by with no thoughts of moon worms and killing—sorry, _sacrificing_—and thick violet-colored blood spraying all over the intended ritual altar.

A thrum builds up into the sky, followed by our traditional hymns. Bronze singing bowls and drums clamor among the roar of villagers in the near distance, a song that marks the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next. Mother, Father, and my siblings will be waiting to bestow me with my Eighteens adornment, either a feathered neck piece or a crown of root and bone. They’re symbolic of what we’ll wear to every formal ceremony we attend from here on out in our adult life.

Except I will be a child forever. And ever.

“Timber, it’s your turn.” Mother’s voice is soothing in the dark void around me. She steps forward in the passageway, lowering the hood of her dark blue cloak. Her long chestnut brown locks fall in waves around her round face. Her ivory skin gleams against the ebbing exchange of light. My crown of root and bone in her left hand draws in the shadows and my heart hammers in my ribs. “All the other Eighteens have finished.”

“I know. I know.”

Her tender hand finds my shoulder and her smile warms my soul. “You don’t have to worry,” she says softly. “Everything is going to happen as it’s meant to.”

I focus on her, feeling my face flush. “I can’t do this, Mother. Not against an innocent life. Even a moon worm.” My throat thickens. “They have souls like you and me.”

She reaches for me and I fall limp in her arms, pressing into her for as long as I can. “It will be a mercy killing,” she coos in my ear, combing my blonde hair with her fingers. “Those that aren’t chosen for sacrifice will be tossed in the Dunes and left to starve. You know it has to be done.”

Thoughts of oozing purple blood swirls in my mind and I force them away. “Is Father angry with me?”

“Nobody is angry, Timber.” She tilts my face to hers ever so slightly. “I worry the Elders will close the ceremony if you wait any longer. You have to go, or you will miss it.”

If I don’t do this, I won’t be allowed proper placement in the village. I’ll be the only Eighteen in my cycle to fail. My parents won’t give me my crown. The Elders will sentence me to the mines for sure. Father will be mortified—he’ll disown me.

“Mother.” I meet her gaze as the traditional hymn plays its second cadence. “Guess it’s now or never.”

She steps aside, opening up the passageway beyond the seething haze. My feet carry me onward while the rest of my body fights each shallow breath writhing within me. Each shudder travels up my spine like a wave. When Raine comes up on my right at the edge of the crowd, his encouraging soft brown eyes catch mine and my shoulders relax. Only a bit.

“You’ve got this,” he mouths.

Other than his crown, Raine wears only a simple pair of tan pants, and his dark shoulder-length hair has been braided back at the nape of his neck. His hand reaches out as I pass. Our fingers linger together for an instant and then I am swept away by the Head Elder, Cyan.

If only I had Raine’s confidence. He was first to complete his Coming of Age ceremony last cycle. Fearless. Positive. Easily admired. The only Watcher I know that gets away with skipping morning strength training. I am nothing like him, and I ponder everyday why I get to be with him. Why he chooses to love me the way he does when there are so many others in the village he’d be better suited for.

Elder Cyan guides me to the edge of the fire. His beige cloak swathes his hefty frame, the fur lining of his hood as white as the hairs on his balding head. Another Elder hands him a small, wooden bowl filled with a blend of ritual oils.

He dips his wrinkled, sun-tanned thumb into the bowl and smears a line of oil on my forehead, another across my chest. My nose flares at the citrus notes and vetiver infused with moonstone.

Elder Cyan’s words are deep and well-practiced. “U evere u lefere, Timber.”

Traditional Vio, the language of our ancestors, is always spoken during ceremonies. We are taught at a young age. I am fluent enough to hold a conversation, to join in during hymns, and his words translate in my head. _We give you life, Timber_. I ignore his blessings and come up with a more accurate one. _We give you life so you can carelessly take it_.

My parents step forward into the circle and leave Marlowe to tend to our brothers.

Elder Cyan clears his throat. We return our attention and he gestures to my parents. “U ofere u yere soere u adere. U der?”

_I offer up your son to adulthood. Do you?_

“U der,” Father says and Mother echoes him.

Elder Cyan kneels where he stands, allowing my parents and I to approach the large wooden barrel set next to a flattened rock altar dripping with purple blood. My hands find the rim of the barrel and I swallow the bile creeping up my throat. _You have to do this_.
