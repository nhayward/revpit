### Query

THE LONELY HEARTS SUPPER CLUB is an adult contemporary romance that will appeal to fans of Lucy Parker’s _Battle Royal_ and Talia Hibbert’s _Act Your Age, Eve Brown_. It’s as if “The Bear” were a rom com, and a bit more like “Gilmore Girls.” The manuscript is 93,000 words. 

Belle Brooks, disgraced chef and reborn bed and breakfast owner, is happily settling into the rest of her delightfully boring and uneventful life in a quiet Minnesota suburb. After her disastrous exit from the elite NYC dining world, she’s relearning the basics—how to cook, how to eat, and how to love herself again. It’s going perfectly fine. Even if her sister still isn’t talking to her. When Devon, an attractive and prickly mystery guest checks in, she doesn’t think twice about inviting him to her dinner party. Dessert comes in many forms, right?
 
Devon Price can taste the promotion. Full time food critic positions are hard to come by, and he’s one tiny, precise, perfect bite away. Then his life, his plans, and his fourth course are interrupted by a phone call from his mother and a ticket booked for his hometown. But in the lifeless pit of Midwestern suburbia, the last thing he expects to find is the infamous and illusive Belle Brooks. And she’s running a kitschy B&B. When the opportunity of a lifetime lands in your lap, you eat it. Right? 

Two days after a steamy post-dinner kiss, Devon’s review goes live—the article is a hit. If only it were positive... When guests start to cancel reservations and financial backers pull their investments, Belle and Devon need to decide: can they move past their boiling resentment and sizzling attraction in order to save the B&B? And what happens when they discover the feelings simmering underneath?

### First Five Pages

Devon Price was on the fourth course: a seared matsutake mushroom served over a sunchoke purée and topped with a virgin tomato foam, which the waiter had pronounced toe-_mah_-toe, managing to sound completely serious. This had pleased Devon. The dish was covered by a cage formed from crystalized chives that shattered at the slightest pressure of his fork. 

It was marvelous. 

The only sounds that Devon could hear in the green velvet room were the soft clinking of spoons against porcelain and the even softer murmur of guests, who only broke the collective silence with hums and gasps in praise of Chef Antoni Giovanni and his ingenious tasting menu. The winner of six Michelin stars, Giovanni had finally opened his most exclusive, most refined, and most inventive dining experience yet. Or so Devon would write in his review to be published on Sunday. He was angling for a promotion to the premiere fine dining critic of Food & Drink, one of the few serious positions left at the magazine (or really the world, as it felt nowadays). He had listened through a full two episodes of his favorite breathing exercise podcast on his way on the subway, rather than his usual one (and a half). 

Devon collected a bite on his fork. He first layered the puree, then a one-inch cube of the mushroom that he’d sliced. The matsutake cut like butter. He spooned a quarter of a tablespoon of the foam towards the back of the fork and carefully topped the foam with a piece of the shattered chive cage. In this order, his tongue would first taste the purée, and the tip would shatter the chive. Then, he’d apply pressure to the mushroom, which would melt in his mouth, mixing with the tomato foam to ensure maximum flavor and texture distribution. 

Devon smiled at the fork. It was something he was good at, figuring out how to properly eat a dish. It was tedious, and a bit self-indulgent, but Devon hated the thought that he might not enjoy something as much as someone else because he’d done it wrong. He glanced around the dining room, where parties of two brought dainty morsels to their mouths, their eyes shimmering against the candlelight.
 
Devon was having an exceptionally good time. The last time he remembered himself enjoying a dinner this much, he was just out of college, spending a good chunk of his college savings at Poison, an avant-garde dining experience thought up by the once-notorious darling (read: menace) of New York fine dining, Belladonna. But she’d disappeared from New York about two years ago. It was a shame. Devon would have liked to see what she did next. 

A phone vibrated, and Devon’s heart bolted at the sudden noise. Though it didn’t ring one of those horrible, contrived jingles, the phone was easily the loudest thing in the room. Patrons glanced up from their meals, and the spell that Devon always wished to find in dining experiences was momentarily broken. 

He sighed and took a sip of the 2019 Zibbibo natural wine that was paired with the dish. 

The phone buzzed again. 

Devon eyed the young socialite with silver blonde hair to his right whose bored smile and dull eyes did not bode well for her knee-bouncing date. It was probably her phone, as she was the youngest in the room, apart from himself, and most likely to be taking photos, despite the strict sign at the entrance that told patrons to turn phones to silent and keep them away. Or perhaps she was receiving one of those purposefully timed bad-date rescue calls, which Devon might have allowed for at any other restaurant. _But not here_. 

It buzzed again, and Devon cleared his throat, glancing kindly in the socialite’s direction. She turned her head to him, interest brightening her eyes before they shifted just past his shoulder. He had barely looked back to his fork before a low voice buzzed against his ear. 

“Your phone, sir,” the waiter said. Devon glanced back at the waiter in shock. The waiter’s black suit barely crinkled as he bent his body down towards Devon. 

“My—” Devon looked around, embarrassed. The waiter reached into the brief case at Devon’s feet and took out the phone, which buzzed again in his hand. The waiter’s white glove seemed tainted by the piece of technology, and the bright colors on the screen glowed garishly against the deep green velvet walls. 

“Do you need to step out—”

“No, no. It’s fine. Let me see…” Devon blinked at the screen, which was populated by texts from, of all people, his mother. He hadn’t thought to silence his phone because, well, he didn’t get that many calls. He briefly wondered if it was related to his trip to Minnesota next week. 

MOM: Devon, call me. 

I need to speak to you. 

ASAP.

Devon’s heartrate spiked. He took a breath in through his nose, and out. This could wait two more hours. His mom tended to send the most heart shuttering texts that usually prompted Devon to drop everything and race to the phone, only to be asked, “what’s our Netflix password again? Your dad lost it.” He shook his head and pocketed his phone. 

As the waiter whisked away his fourth course, Devon’s mind wandered to his home in Edenton, Minnesota. He hated the Midwest. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He’d disliked growing up there and had bolted as soon as he could for the East Coast. Rather, Devon hated car-centric cities and shopping malls. He hated the suburban life that seemed to swallow everyone he grew up with. A life of Chipotle’s and bread bowls filled with steaming vats of broccoli cheddar at the threadbare booths in Panera Bread. 

Even Casey, Devon’s closest—only—friend he’d managed to keep from home, was _married_, with a _child_, and a _mortgage_, in a _cul-de-sac_. A child whose baptism Devon would be attending in a few short weeks. Because he was going to be—appointed? anointed? christened?—a godfather. 

It wasn’t that Devon hadn’t wanted to accept. Right before Casey asked, his voice had slowed into something serious, nearly reverent, which was the only reason Devon had known it wasn’t a joke. Casey was never serious. He had the type of voice that couldn’t help but curl into a smile. 

Devon had said yes, mostly out of a decade’s long instinct to do just about anything for the person who had endured the worst parts of him. In middle school, no less. But he hadn’t asked Casey the one question bouncing around his head on the other end of the line: why him? 

Devon wasn’t particularly fatherly, or godly for that matter. And he was halfway across the country, with no intentions of shortening that distance anytime soon. 

His phone pulsed in his pocket—this time it was a call. He declined. Devon closed his eyes and inhaled a deep breath that pushed back against the growing constrictions in his chest. His mother could wait. 

_Just an hour. I just need an hour, and I won’t have wasted six years on a profession that you don’t think exists outside of goddamn Ratatouille._

And this interruption really could not have come at a worse time. If any whisper of this got out, he might have to resign. Out of embarrassment, if nothing else. 

Shannon, a culture editor at Food & Drink, had once call him “intense,” after the office had all gone out for drinks. It was the only time they invited him. He knew they respected his dedication and professionalism, even if they had a bit more fun on the job, or however she’d put it. He didn’t mind their judgement. He knew he came off as stuck-up at best, but it meant he didn’t get assigned to cover the newest Instagram restaurant or whatever the hell they were doing to a croissant next, like the rest of them. 

His phone buzzed again, and Devon could feel the stares from staff and patrons alike, boring into his neck. The blonde glanced at him, annoyed. _I deserve that_. 

“Excuse me,” he said to no one in particular, though it seemed to bounce against the carpeted walls of the small, circular room. Devon rushed to the men’s room, checking each stall, and locking the door before he answered the phone.

“What?” His whisper shot out of his throat. 

“Oh, Devon,” his mother answered, surprise lacing her voice. “You picked up. How are you?” 

“Quite inconvenienced at the moment, Mom. What on earth is going on?” Devon bit into his phone.
