### Query

Two academic rivals die at their graduation party and are forced to haunt the same house. YOU’RE DEAD TO ME (68,000 words) is a YA speculative fiction with paranormal flair, a little mystery, and a big dose of romance.

Tessa Sinclair loves Second Place—her favorite vintage store in Albany, not her lot in life. Ever since Reed Walker moved to town, that stealer of spelling bee trophies and science fair titles, Tessa’s been robbed of her glory. Now he likes to flaunt his valedictorian status and Harvard acceptance in her face daily. So, when Reed dares Tessa to “live a little” and attend a graduation rager in an abandoned mansion outside of town, Tessa’s pride gets the better of her and she goes. 

When Tessa ends up dying at the party, it appears that both life, and death, suck. Being a ghost is hard enough, but it’s a bajillion times worse when Tessa learns she wasn’t the only student to die that night. Reed Walker is there too, deceased, smug, and as annoying as ever. The house is divided, and they retreat to R.I.P. in their respective corners. But as Tessa and Reed discover which supernatural laws they can bend and learn from a séance that their deaths were no accident, they decide to team up to ensure their murderer never strikes again. 

With Tessa’s best friend in the killer’s crosshairs next, and their time on this plane limited, they’ll need to overcome their differences to try to save her before it’s too late. And should they happen to fall for each other along the way, well, who ever said you can’t find love after death? 

YOU’RE DEAD TO ME has the academic rivalry of _Never Have I Ever_, the afterlife limbo of _Beetlejuice_, and the romantic and metaphysical hijinks of Rachel Lynn Solomon’s _See You Yesterday_.

**AFTER**

The crumbling floorboards creak as the house shifts on its aging foundation. Gusts of wind howl against its bones, rocketing the shutters back and forth, sending ice-cold breath slipping through the crevices. Each sound a new note in an orchestration of decay—rot blooming, a rustle of wings, the scampering of mice. I should feel cold. I should feel spooked. 

But I don’t. 

Old houses make noises. And if anything is here to press frozen fingers against the necks of unsuspecting victims, it’s us. 

**Chapter 1 **
**
BEFORE**

LONG LIVE BEER AND BROS

_Are you kidding me?_ My feet skid to a stop as I stare up at the large block letters rearranged for senior prank day over our high school entrance. Every year the graduating class tries to outdo the one before. Last June, they toilet papered the halls and stole all the furniture out of the teacher’s lounge; before that, all the classroom doors went missing—until the janitor found them on the roof. I’m sure beer and bros is just the beginning.

Students are already starting to crowd the entrance, gawking at the sign, snapping photos, and smacking one another on the back. Apparently, a lot of dudes are going to miss a lot of other dudes. It’s hard being a bro on the eve of graduation. 

I knew we shouldn’t have scheduled the Marjory Fieldman Honor Roll luncheon for today. I begged Principal Evans to postpone to next week, but did he listen? No. And now sensible-shoe-wearing, church-choir-conducting Marjory Fieldman herself will probably turn around with her giant custom-sized scholarship check for $10,000 and hightail it out of here in moral outrage over ‘kids these days.’ Goodbye scholarship. Goodbye financial aid. Goodbye, all hope for my future. 

“Your strawberry milk tea with boba, milady.” Brandon, my longtime boyfriend, stops beside me with my morning fix of tapioca pearls. 

“Are you seeing this?” I gesture pointedly towards the word scramble above, foot tapping in righteous indignation. Brielle van der Born, our high school namesake, must be turning over in her grave. Or maybe not. She was Dutch. I’m pretty sure they like beer.  

“I got a photo when I parked my car. Only one spot left at the back of the senior lot. You’re so lucky you get a reserved space with the teachers. The perks of being Student Body President.” He sighs wistfully. Brandon isn’t ambitious, but he’s happy to live vicariously off my ambition. I’m not entirely sure why we’re still together—except he’s always so sweet with the boba.

I take a pull off the straw and get a delicious hit of chewy tapioca goodness. “That’s why I ran for president, for the perks. And the tea.” I give him a quick peck on the cheek. “Why did you take a picture?”

“I don’t know. It’s funny. I wanted a memory of our wild high school days.” He pumps his fists in the air while head banging like we’re at a concert, then almost loses his balance.  

“No offense, Brandon, but there is nothing about me, you, or our high school days that is remotely wild.” 

Brandon’s more…dependable, like a warm sock. He’s mildly cute if you catch him in the right light, when his shaggy, sandy hair is out of his eyes. But he’s about as wild as a potted plant. Brandon likes tea. And jazz. Not to play, just to listen to in his car. His idea of a fun Friday night is to swap Calculus notes…and listen to some jazz…in our warm socks. 

My life is so depressing. 

At the edge of the parking lot, Danica Chaudhari and her boyfriend Davis Miller are taking selfies as they kiss with the sign in the background. I wish we did that more often, but it’s like Brandon and I have forgotten what it even means to be a couple. Trying to resurrect whatever spark we used to have, I turn to him with my most sultry and smoldering expression wondering if we’ll do the same, but he’s busy tugging a string loose from his shirt.

“Is there something on my face?” he asks when he catches me staring. 

So much for romance and excitement. I turn my attention back to the sign, trying to will the letters into place. How long until Janitor Bailey can get a ladder up there to rearrange them? Assuming there aren’t more pressing horrors awaiting inside. Teetotaling Ms. Fieldman once huffed out of a church fundraising dinner for Habitat for Humanity after they served wine to the adults in attendance. I can’t chance her getting offended now and pulling that scholarship. Neither of my parents attended college, but my dad especially is counting on me to finish what he couldn’t. _Life has a way of derailing you, so don’t let that happen, kid_, he’d said, and I don’t plan on it. My life’s mapped out perfectly, my course charted. I know exactly what I want—two years at SUNY Albany so I can remain close while my father gets back on his feet after losing his job, before transferring to NYU to study chemistry and eco-friendly textile design. Then, I’ll be ready to wage my one-woman war against the wasteful fast-fashion industry. All I have to do now is see it through. 

“So...there’s just one beer for all those bros to share?”

“There’s only one S.” I say, squinting up at the sign and running all the letters that would normally herald the entrance to the Brielle van der Born High School through my head. 

“Why not long live beers and bro then? Isn’t it better to share many beers with one good bro than one beer with many bros and only get a sip each?”

A laugh flies out of my mouth, startling me. “Brandon, you made a funny.”

“I didn’t say anything.” He shrugs. 

What? Who’ve I been talking to? I turn to stare at Brandon, standing next to me, gazing up at the entrance sign, and that’s when I realize there’s someone standing next to him. That someone leans forward, a smirk lighting up his face. Reed Walker. My nemesis since the 6th grade, when he moved to our upstate New York town from wherever evil spawns. Denver, apparently. Valedictorian to my salutatorian. Stealer of spelling bee trophies and science fair titles. The smile drops off my face faster than Ms. Fieldman dashing out of here in her sensible shoes clutching my giant check. 

Reed arches an eyebrow at me. “I mean, with all those letters at their disposal, they could have been more creative and gone with...” he takes a moment to consider, “...neighborhood hellraiser?”

What is going on right now?

“Or...maybe...” He points at the school entrance, “doing believable horrors.” 

“How are you word scrambling these so fast?”

Reed winks at me. He enjoys rubbing his stupid hyper-computing robot brain in my face. 

I glare at the sign. Then the letters start to shift in my imagination and take shape. “Wait. Um...alien...um...slobbering alien...overlord! Slobbering alien overlord,” I scream, jumping up and down, proud I found one. Brandon high fives me. 

Reed taps his chin while he concentrates, determined to best me. “How about...” He snaps his fingers, looking me right in the eye, “Horrible Brandon.” 

He’s arrived at the idea like it’s obvious. So rude.

“Hey, my name’s in the sign!”  

I roll my eyes at Reed. I have no time for smug entitled pricks. “Don’t you have other people to torture?” 

“So, Reed,” says Brandon, oblivious, moving the conversation along. “You ready for your speech next week?” 

“Pretty much.” He shrugs. “Will you be accompanying the ice princess to graduation?”

“Who?”

“He means me.” I sigh.
