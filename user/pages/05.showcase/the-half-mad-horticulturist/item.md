### Query

Olive Vandriel, self-identified Virtuous Heroine™, has toiled her whole life with naught but one dream: finding her father. Okay, two: getting a certain hero with Big Knight Energy to whisk her away. That is, until she discovers her hero is actually a villain serving a Masked Woman hell-bent on locating a mythical flower that—how shocking—grants eternal life. 

The shadowy Masked Woman—who likes to throw shade—pillages Olive’s town, destroying her home, before kidnapping the key to finding the flower: a princess-cum-child bride from the same rival desert nation as Olive's father. Thus, with nothing left to delay her #EpicQuest, Olive teams up with the princess’ guardian, a dashing rogue with a bad habit of mansplaining. Together with his two companions—one lovestruck smuggler with a heart of gold (conned off a mark), and one homicidal, alcoholic sociopath—she’ll help them rescue the princess from a fate far, far worse than marriage. 

And maybe also get a free ride back to their homeland, where she can search for her father at last. For if Olive can't find her one chance at having a real family—and figure out why all the clues about his identity are curiously connected to the flower—she fears she'll go full-mad. 

Smidge more pressing: stopping the Masked Woman from using the princess to unearth the flower and ultimately bring about a new world order of her own sadistic design.  

THE HALF-MAD HORTICULTURIST (115,000 words, Adult Comedy/Fantasy) is the meta romantic romp of _The Princess Bride_ meets the globe-hopping treasure hunt of _Uncharted_, set in a world that alludes to, and pokes fun at, our own socio-political climate and culture. It will appeal to fans of _Good Omens_ for its tongue-in-cheek darkness, and _Six of Crows_ for its quippy camaraderie. It is a standalone novel with series potential. And cannibal horses. 

I have an Honours BFA in Screenwriting and Creative Writing from York University, and have attended the Humber Creative Writing Workshop, where I was mentored by award-winning author Joseph Kertes (_The Afterlife of Stars_), who recommended I query. I currently work as a closed captioning supervisor. And like Olive, I am Brown (Afghan Muslim), though unlike Olive, I don't have crippling daddy issues.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

### First Five Pages

**Chapter 1: _The First Chapter_**

The moment she'd been born, having rather rudely killed their mother on the way out, Olive Vandriel had catapulted her slippery self into her befuddled half-sister's arms. And in that moment, deep within the babe's soul, had sprouted the greatest hindrance what ever would hinder: the ache. It would grow to be an ache of dullness, of darkness, and of discontentment. 

Quite ironically, so would Olive. 

Her ache, however, would grow so intense that by the age of four, it had warranted capitalization and become The Ache. When she'd skipped through the market by the castle as a child, she'd burdened her fellow townsfolk by forcing them to speculate how she, tanned and crow-haired as she was, had come to trouble the poor fair blonde scuttling five steps ahead. 

And The Ache had grown. 

When she'd tended to her patients as a teenager, being the most reputable—and cheapest—physician in the United Provinces of East Erapor, Forever More Virile and Prosperous than West Erapor, they'd had to endure her chipper grin whilst her gloved fingers went to town on their wart-pocked genitals. 

And The Ache had grown. 

When enunciated, which, now at twenty-one, she'd finally given up insisting upon, even her name was a faff. Granted, unlike a quite literal one hundred percent of Olive's personality, her name was not her fault. Lydia, said poor-fair-blonde-befuddled half-sister, had chosen it, after a dead great-aunt, and not at all because a jar of the bulbous green things had soured in the larder two weeks after her birth and she'd found the moniker apt. Indeed, one could slur the name together to form Olivandriel, but that would possess a whimsy so wholly, so overwhelmingly, so… _cringingly_ twee—it just broke me and the fourth wall at once. 

What the fuck is this, you're wondering. A perfectly sensible question, considering I've also been rather rudely catapulted out of what had otherwise been a masterclass in impartiality. 

I am The Narrator. And I always warrant capitalization.

Despite my position, please do refrain from misconstruing what you're about to read. This is not an endorsement of Olive as a person. It's not even an endorsement of her as a protagonist. Yes, unfortunately for us both, Olive Vandriel is the titular half-mad horticulturist, the one from whom whatever sanity and/or plant-based hijinks you're hoping for shall derive. And there will be many. Nonetheless, we are not here to laugh ourselves giddy at her sad joke of a life, much as we might be tempted. And it will be tempting. We are here because her life was about to change.

The Ache was about to implode. 

And it _will_ be chaotic. 

Talking of hot messes—I suppose I mustn't lollygag further and introduce Olive where she is at present, in her garden alone. _Alone_ being of utmost import, for it was the only way she could avoid inconveniencing anyone. 

Well, apart from me. 

***

Black soil caked under Olive's nails as she dug into the cool, damp earth. She stroked the forks of each rubbery root, traced each miniature subterranean map. With her knees nestled in the ground, her rust-hued skirt splayed around her, she looked rather like the delicate bloom cradled betwixt her palms. 

To her, however, the bloom looked rather like it was begging to have its pale, wrinkled stem wrung so hard its eyeballs popped out and spurted treacly fluid onto a face she could ram into the dirt again and again 'til there was nary left but blood-drenched blonde curls and teeth. 

Olive gasped. It was a horridly awful, awfully horrid thought, she knew, and she shook it away with a shudder, of the cheek-wobbling variety. What she didn't know was why she'd thought it. With all her reaping and sowing day in and day out, she could only surmise she'd been bound to fantasize about brutally murdering Lydia at some point. 

Olive nodded, satisfied with that logic, and returned to her work. Just beyond her field of view, a horde of spiders wriggled onto the petals of the _Natus ignethium_ before her. She was usually mindful of them, but her movements this morning had been slower with her mind distracted. And so, she didn't notice the spiders slink up the fraying sleeve of her shift. Then across the weathered leather of her corset. Then right down her bodice. 

"_FFFFUCK!_" 

Olive shot up, flailed her arms to empty her top, then stomped on the ground in a frenzy. Breathless, she readjusted her corset, pushing her breasts back up with a humph and a grunt and a realization that the spiders had scurried in where no man had been for far too long. 

Then she looked down. 

The flowers were destroyed. Petals stuck to her soles, pasted with gooey innards. She fought back a growl. That had been her last bunch, meaning she would have to go into town now, a deed she ordinarily would've been thrilled with were she not trying to avoid a certain Eastguard officer, cheekbone proprietor, and one of the aforementioned men who'd yet to make intimate contact where she yearned for it most. 

No, not there, but what lay beneath her bosom: her _heart_. 

Olive scorned herself for how they'd left things last they spoke, after she'd professed her feelings. He didn't feel the same, she was sure. If his silence hadn't been enough to clarify that fact, the immediate running away had certainly done it. 

Perhaps that was why she'd been distracted lately, she wondered. Perhaps it wasn't The Ache growing again, but the ache deep, deep down in her—

"Six and a half hells! You've gone and woken up Lionel!" 

Olive turned around to see Lydia, half-sister, half-beast, standing at the threshold of their house. Her gaze lowered to the dead flowers. Then back up to Olive. 

"Oh, shit," Olive blurted, and though both actions were futile, she darted to block the mess and grinned. 

Lydia marched over, shoulders heaving in her wisp of a nightgown, greying blonde curls tossed about by the wind. For a moment, Olive thought she could see steam whistling from her ears. But no, that was just the soft fog of dawn rolling in from the sea below. 

As the distance between them narrowed, Lydia's features grew clearer: as dull and hard and craggy as the cliff their house rested atop. Lydia was twenty centimetres shorter than Olive, twenty years her senior, and—you've guessed it—twenty times as cross. 

Alas, Olive had not a looking glass nor a gently flowing river by which she could kneel and gaze into forlornly, so she could not describe her own physical appearance vis-à-vis humble brag. So, no talk of how malnourishment led to a skinny figure which mysteriously retained fat in all the right places—bosom and bottom. No mention of how she bit down on her plump, pouty lips—naturally red, _naturally_—when nervous. And no bringing up how most men gawked at her, which she attributed to her foreign features, and not for any other reason it would be inconceivable for a heroine to see in herself.

Lydia struck Olive hard across the cheek, painting it a rather lovely rosy shade. 

"You. Utter. _Dumbarse_." 

Lydia's thin lips furled, the creases etched into her forehead digging deeper. The years had not been kind to Lydia, but then again, Lydia had not been kind to the years—or anything else for that matter.

"And my bestseller, too. I had a dozen orders to fill today. Done did this on purpose, you did. I swear, if I get a patient in nine months' time with a blubberin' tot at her tit she don't want 'cause o' this…."

"Spiders! There were spiders everywhere, eating the _Natus ignethium_."

"Ooh, better wipe down the speculum! 'Er Majesty Queen Karen's comin' for a checkup."

"Eating the, er, no-babies-breath. I had to destroy them before the spiders' venom could spread. Why, the flowers were well and truly worthless."

"Mm. Suppose you would know." Lydia struck her again, knocking her to the dirt, and sneered like the double meaning was lost on Olive. 

It wasn't. 

"A good thing I caught them when I did, too. They would've ruined our business had we sold…." Olive flinched, realizing her mistake too late. 

"Our business?" Lydia grabbed her by the hair, twisting the tangled mess, and yanked her to her knees. "You think just 'cause you sit and play in your pretty little garden all day this business is yours? After everythin' Lionel and I have done for you? Fed you. Gave you a bed. Quashed any attempts at running away by convincing you the world'll never love or accept you. I swear, no matter 'ow hard we try, it'll never be enough to cleanse the freeloadin' Nambyrian outta your blood, will it?"

"No, sister."
