### Query

LOGIN TO MY HEART is a 77,000 word YA contemporary romance with fantasy gaming elements. It has dual offline and online world narratives as shown in Eric Smith’s _Don’t Read The Comments_, contains themes from Francesca Zeppia’s _Eliza and her Monsters_, and worldbuilding similar to the anime _Sword Art Online_.

Online, Mireille is a famous gametuber and the best Healer of a virtual reality online game called _Age of Aeon (AoA)_. Offline, no one knows she’s the shy seventeen-year old, Chinese-Indonesian Riley Lin, who keeps her online identity a secret in fear her online and offline differences would disappoint the fans. Their only similarity is the compulsive need to be the best at everything, whether it’s getting her online guild to the top spot, beating academic rival Nolan Park for her dream internship, ensuring she gets enough likes on her latest videos, or being the perfect daughter by planning a family trip she really doesn’t want to go on.

When a reckless comment she made online goes viral, Riley is forced to recruit the game’s top-ranked assassin, Valeo, to her guild. He agrees under the condition that Mireille marries him in-game and helps him with the game’s hardest quest. While Valeo takes her in-game life to new heights through their surprisingly great teamwork, things get more complicated offline when she has to promote AoA for her marketing class. Keeping her online identity a secret proves to be a challenge when Nolan, her project partner, happens to be Mireille’s biggest fan.

Riley’s growing attraction for both Nolan and Valeo suddenly seem like a simple side-quest when her real identity is leaked, threatening both her online reputation, her offline chance at the internship, and her family’s safety. Riley must decide whether to go incognito and completely erase Mireille’s existence, or face the hardest battle by embracing both her online and offline identities as part of herself.

I was born in the Netherlands, studied in the US, and reside in Indonesia. I studied advertising to become a visual storyteller and realized I like storytelling even without the visual aspect of it. I wrote this as a love letter to online games and my online friends who are like family. This story also explores how one presents themselves differently when online.

Please be advised that trigger warnings include cyber bullying, death threats, online sexual harassment, and occasional graphic depictions of in-game characters and monsters being killed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Most people wouldn’t spend an entire weekend editing a five-minute game tutorial. Then again, most people weren’t the top-ranked healer in a popular online game whose gaming channel just hit one million subscribers.

What I didn’t expect was to celebrate my achievement being in complete shock. Because at the 2:48 mark of the video—the same video I had replayed, edited, and reviewed nearly a hundred times before uploading it three minutes ago—I discovered one of my worst enemies. A typo.

“To spot hidden enemies in a new area, don’t forget to _pee_ all over the surrounding,” Jeremy, one of my closest online friends and the co-leader of our guild, read during our Discord group call. He had discovered the same typo, along with 300 other subscribers who pointed out the exact timestamp in the comments. 

 “Pee? Can our avatars do that?” Serena, who didn’t understand the game after months of playing, genuinely asked.

“Peek! It’s supposed to be _peek_!”

Jeremy didn’t spare me the embarrassment and burst out in uncontrollable cackles. He was so loud I had to turn down my speaker’s volume. 

“Technically, you’re not wrong. Peeing all over the surroundings would make enemies jump up and give away their location,” Ela, my other online friend, mused. “But if I were you, I would be _pissed_ too.”

Jeremy, whose laughter had faded, erupted in a second burst of hysterics. 

I buried my face in my hand and groaned. The right thing to do was to delete this video and upload a new one with the correct subtitles. But… the video already gained over 2,000 views and 367 likes. Comments kept coming in every second. This video had a higher engagement rate than my previous ones. I couldn’t delete it and lose track of my precious numbers. It was a testament of my reputation as Mireille.

No one but my three best friends knew about my online alter ego. As a gametuber, Mireille always gave the latest tips and tricks for the popular MMORPG called _Age of Aeon_. As a gamer, she was the top healer who had perfected the Divine Resurrection skill. Every healer could resurrect a dead party member, but Mireille was the _only_ one who could resurrect them back to full health. Since the effectiveness of this move depended on a player’s level and experience, skipping mealtimes and pulling all-nighters definitely worked in my favor.

“Riley Lin,” Jeremy called my full name to imitate the same intensity of an Asian parent alerting you were in trouble. Technically, he lacked the effect by not including my Chinese name. “Is this really how you should behave as Valour’s guild leader?”

“Will ‘peeing all over the surrounding’ be a prerequisite for new members to join our guild?” Ela added, clearly holding her giggles.

_Ugh_. Lucky for them, they lived six hours away from the Bay Area (one in New York and the other in Canada). I couldn’t give them a good face-to-face scolding. Serena was the only one who lived nearby and attended Sun Valley High with me. I appreciated her being very civil (and very confused) in this case.

Not that I could ever scold anyone offline, anyway. Without an online avatar to hide behind, I could barely talk to strangers without choking up and wishing to bury myself ten thousand feet below the Earth. 

“Maybe this typo could work in our favor. Maybe it'll drive more players to join our guild because we seem fun,” I said, trying to stay hopeful. 

Our guild, Valour, was ranked third in our entire server. This posed a big threat to my reputation as the eldest daughter of a Chinese-Indonesian family. I was the golden child. And my guild needed to reflect that. Because if I wasn’t the best at everything, what good was I at all? 

“Today we celebrate Mireille’s one million subscribers, tomorrow we celebrate Valour becoming number one!” Ela cheered, her energy contagious even through an online call. She was always filled with so much optimism to fend off my imposter syndrome.

“Yeah! Celebrate by eating the cheesecake we got you instead of all the pee talk!” Serena interrupted.

“Aw, those are two words I never expected to hear in one sentence,” I said, suddenly concerned about the cheesecake sitting in front of me.

I took a photo of it, making sure the ‘congratulations’ written using whipped cream was legible, and uploaded it to my Instagram. For someone who barely updated my social media, posting their gift was a way to appreciate and acknowledge their kindness.

If only I could preserve this cake in a glass case display next to the wall covered with fanarts and love letters from my fans—well, _Mireille’s_ fans. These mementos reminded me that people accepted Mireille online, even if Riley Lin dealt with rejections offline.

“Thank you all so much,” I repeated again, because saying it once wasn’t enough to express the amount of gratitude I had for my friends. I sent a grand wall of “THANK YOU”s into our Discord chat, command C, control V, thirty times.

Then, because the video window was right next to the chat, I couldn’t help myself from scrolling through the comments. My friends warned me against it, but Mireille’s image was all about making people feel welcomed and included. Besides, Mireille was blessed with some of the sweetest fans. Some openly called Mireille their role model and a GOAT, which confused me at first, until Ela explained it stood for ‘greatest of all time.’ 

Until one particular comment made me freeze. My heart skidded to a halt, like an assassin had punctured a dagger there. 

_pi0neer: y is anyone still watching her video? they suck. shes sooo fake. her guild isnt even in the top 3. who does she think she is lmao_

My entire body trembled as I reread those words again and again. To others this may not seem like a big deal, but to me whose entire existence depended on _Age of Aeon_, it was a critical hit. Suddenly, every single word of adoration I read mere seconds ago faded from my mind. A thick veil clouded over the walls where the fanarts and fanmails were plastered. All I could focus on were these words that defined my worth… My failure… 

This hater saw through my Mireille pretense and saw Riley Lin instead.

“Hey, Ri? Are you okay? What happened?” Ela asked. I had no idea how I sounded over our call for her to notice something wrong.

“Um, I’m good…” I strained my voice to speak. I didn’t want them to worry, or hear a handful of their “I told you not to read the comments.”

“Oh, shit. I see a comment from Pioneer,” Serena brought out. Apparently, she was also reading through the comments.

“Again? Block them already!” Ela yelled like she was marching out for battle. I didn’t doubt her ability to rally Mireille’s fans and attack the hater, which was why I needed to quickly stop this.

“It’s okay. I can handle this.” I swallowed.

“Ri, those attention-seeking trolls are people with no life who have too much time on their hands to make others miserable. They’re not worth your time.” Jeremy sounded like he was ready to fly down here just to shut my computer down and stop me from reading.

“Don’t worry. This is a good opportunity to build Mireille’s image.” I managed a weak laugh, not entirely believing my own words. “Alright, I’ll have to go convert a hater into a fan. Thanks again for the cake and everything. You guys are the best.”

I didn’t wait for their replies and ended our call before they convinced me to stop. I took a deep breath, mentally casting a buff spell to increase my courage.

Talking to people offline was something I dreaded because I never knew what to say and worried about the things I _did_ end up saying. If I could go into conversations carrying cue cards, I would. 

Online, I had time to craft the most eloquent version of my response before posting it for everyone to see. I wanted Mireille to be the caring figure who fought haters with kindness.

_Mireille: haha I’m sorry if I’m still lacking. I will do my best to improve my future videos and guild rank :)_
