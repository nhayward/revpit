### Query

**Please note the content warning for this query and sample: mention of gun violence and suicide.**

Dear Agent:

It's bad enough CIA officer Helena Deane is under suspicion of espionage by the FBI. The real kicker? Her own husband is one of the investigators. 

Following an op gone wrong that leaves her boss dead, Helena is questioned by the FBI. Their search for the true culprit, responsible for at least nine deaths–including Helena’s asset–means going backward through six years of Helena’s memories. 

Facing the truth means facing the damage she’s wrought along the way. Telling her story to interrogators, Helena seeks absolution from her own betrayals while building a case against a mole, a handler, and the dangerous spy chief behind it all. But looking at old events through new eyes means Helena uncovers more secrets as she tries to solve a mystery that has haunted her for six years. Helena needs to navigate the interrogation deftly, because if everything gets exposed, there goes her marriage…and possibly, her life. 

THE COUNTER-CLOCK SPY is a 92,000-word psychological thriller reminiscent of Karen Cleveland’s _Need to Know_ and Alma Katsu’s _Red Widow_. Taking a critical look at the morality of espionage and America’s role in the global community, it is #ownvoices for POC, disability, and LGBTQ rep, and is told in reverse chronology. This manuscript is a RevPit 2023 winner and has been revised under the guidance of an experienced developmental editor. 

I am a former intelligence officer-turned-mom of four who writes genre-bending fiction about badass women, dual loyalty, and the false promise of patriotism. I’m also an Author-Mentor Match mentee for a previous manuscript. 

Thank you for your consideration.

**Chapter 1**

_Year Six, August_

_Present Day_

The absurdity is: I can’t stop thinking of Aldrich Ames.

You know the guy. Infamous CIA mole. Sold out a bunch of assets to the Soviet Union. After being nabbed, Ames sat in an FBI vehicle, thought long and hard about his circumstances, and said one word: “Fuck.” 

So that’s it. How fucked, exactly, am I?

I too am in the back of an FBI sedan. My ears are ringing. I am still. So still. 

“Oh, God.” I rub my face with both hands. I’m not handcuffed. There is that. 

I wanted to scream when John Brevet, that fool, pulled the trigger. But I didn’t. I'm strangely proud of that. 

And if I can keep my wits about me, I can make up for this disaster. 

The front car doors open. David slides into the passenger seat. He pulls off his glasses and wipes the condensation. It’s too damn hot. The DC swamp. Literal and figurative.

“Trundle!” David calls across to the driver’s side. “Quit your yakking and let’s go.” 

The open driver’s door wobbles, the glint causing me to squint in surprise. “Yeah boss,” returns the disembodied voice. “Sorry.” 

Special Agent Sef Trundle ducks his head in and surveys the situation. I raise a hand in greeting. Sef, baby blues with an innocent face, grunts his satisfaction and slides in. 

The car hiccups and lurches into motion. My breaths come faster. I work to slow them, rubbing my thighs against the cloth seat, letting the friction ground me. What kind of car is this? Taurus? Impala? 

I trained in a Crown Vic. Crash and Bang school at The Farm. Man-down drills, evasion procedures. Exciting stuff that makes you pee adrenaline. 

David pulls the sun visor down, eyes full of worry as he regards me through his mirror.

“How are you?”

“I didn’t scream.” 

Sef snorts softly in the driver’s seat. 

The smell of tuna assaults me. David must have had it for lunch. Between that and the heat, the bile rises. 

I didn’t scream but I might just throw up.

I lost my chance. Forever, probably. There’s no way I can secure what the Feds need. Not after the shooting.

Maybe I’ll end up the scapegoat. But I’m not sure I’d survive the experience, especially with Antonin Silva after me.

David rotates more fully in his seat. “Glad it’s over?”

_It’s over, it’s over_, I think, looking at David. He realizes what he’s said and turns away.

“It’s not over,” I say truthfully, swallowing the bile. “It’s just beginning.”

I wish I were talking about us. Like we were three years ago, at the beginning of our journey of matrimony. But instead, I’m talking about a nightmare. 

The air conditioner is on full blast, but not helping much. The car is old. The thrum of the a/c reverberates in my ears like background static. It’s either going to put me to sleep or put me into sensory overload, terrifying me, like I’m in a horror movie and a hand might emerge from the ether and strangle me. I play the game I always play with myself. Lean into it. When it’s cold, open my body wide and let it hit. When it’s raining, revel in the feel of droplets slithering. Now, let the static of the car soothe. Meditate with it. 

The drive to our destination is interminable in the DC traffic. Sef turns onto the state highway, heading toward the Beltway to Vienna.

“We’re diverting before your house.” Sef explains. “I’m sorry. I should’ve kept my weapon holstered.”

Neither David nor I respond. 

Everyone else got to go home after that debacle. David and I, though, are going to be tied up for hours. 

_And not in the way I’d like_, my friend Julie would've said, if she were here. She did scream when the gun fired, her eyes wide in terror.

I should send her flowers. What a thought.

“The ceilings were popcorn. It’s gonna make the brain matter really hard to clean up.” I hear myself saying this, in a dreamy tone, not all there. 

The car is deathly silent. 

“You’re in shock,” David finally says. “Maybe we should wait—” 

“I’m okay,” I interject. “Loopy. But I got this.”

“Sure doesn’t sound like it,” Sef mutters, from the driver seat.

Life. Things occur in wild spurts, one after the other. Until you find yourself at the end and wonder: What the fuck happened?

_There was an old lady who swallowed a horse_. “She’s dead of course,” I murmur.

“What?” 

I shake my head. 

“Helena…”

“I’m okay,” I repeat. David seems unconvinced.

We’re off the Beltway, back on my regular route home, Chain Bridge Road, past Tyson’s Corner, where the FBI first interviewed Aldrich Ames at their satellite office. The shopping center from where KGB defector Vasily Yurechenko made a phone call to the Russian Embassy, telling them he wanted to come home. Past the glamorous National Counterterrorism Center, a place for the new era, not this old, woe-begotten, chewed-up business of counterintelligence. We pass a dilapidated townhome complex near the Vienna metro. The houses aren’t uniform. They each have a unique style, color, and face, looking more like individual homes that have been squished together. 

DC is, as the saying goes, a small town. But it’s also not. When you’re out in the suburbs, you live like canned sardines on top of each other. Or like coffee in a French press: interminably, yet exquisitely, ground down. We’re a small town in the sense we suffocate our citizens. We’re a small town because nobody tells the truth and everyone has their secrets. We’re a small town because of the incestuous nature of government, all in everyone’s business and screwing each others’ wives. 

I peer at David in the front seat. No one is screwing my spouse. I hope. He’s quite a catch. Handsome in that geeky way. Like a movie nerd pre-makeover who was super hot all along. Strong cheekbones and jaw, big eyes behind black-rimmed glasses. Quarter-Armenian heritage, blessing him with an unruly mop of nut-brown hair that flops just so over his forehead. Integrity. Strength. The all-American man. 

I’ve got that going for me. For now. The next few hours may change my good fortune. 

I pull at the collar of my blouse to vent the heat. Boob sweat and armpit stains are no way to make an impression.

Baby’s first interrogation. Ammu would be so proud. 

I try not to think about how my parents would actually take all this. First-generation immigrants from Bengal, patriotic to the bone. My father is a professor of political philosophy. But he’s not the academic in a dusty office, scribbling in tomes like they hold the mysterious spells of a grimoire. My childhood was a whirlwind of international trips. Not only to the homeland, like the other Indian kids in our social group, but all over the world. It gave me an appreciation of how small we are, in the grand scheme of things. 

“Relax.” It’s like David can read my mind. “You’ve handled worse.” 

Sef pulls up to an abandoned office park. I wait patiently in the back. My doors are child-locked. 

\###

The dimly-lit office smells of mold. Maybe asbestos. I’d believe it. We gather around a scratched-up circular wood table in a depressing conference room, wall divider fuzzy-gray with salmon-colored hinges, tall white shelf in the corner looking like it’s going to collapse from boredom. A recorder sits in the middle of the table, and with it, a red-headed man I recognize, waiting patiently, lanky legs up on the table. David’s boss, ASAC Bill Warrington, the assistant special agent in charge of counterintelligence at the Washington Field Office. A GS-15. David’s in line to make that relatively soon. Or was. Until me. All this cannot be helping his career prospects. 

Warrington doesn’t stand to greet me. Just watches me with reptilian eyes as I make my way to the seat. 

“So,” he begins. “We had an unofficial deal.”

“Yes, sir,” I offer nervously.

He snorts. “Bill. I’m Bill.” 

I don’t respond. He’s been to my house. We’ve toasted each other at happy hours. Most recently, we planned David’s birthday party. 

“Did you get it?” he asks.
