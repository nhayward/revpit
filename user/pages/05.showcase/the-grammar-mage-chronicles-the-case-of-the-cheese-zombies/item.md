Living in a small town on the edge of the San Francisco Bay Area, sixth-grader Sloane Gamez is one of the rare people who can write stories that change reality. More than anything, she wants to grow up to be a detective for the Council of Mages. Sloane spends her free time practicing magic and looking for mysteries to solve, training for the day when her job will be to stop people from misusing magic—like the witch who cursed her best friend’s mom.

When Sloane’s best friend asks for help pulling off an epic Halloween prank, they whip up a fun horde of cheesy zombies using his skills with baking and hers with magic. Their plan goes wrong after someone steals and alters her spell. Her cartoonish zombies change, growing taller with tattered gray skin and a growl like wet gravel tossed into a garbage disposal. They lurch across the town, shattering store windows and attacking everyone they see.

With a quick bit of writing, Sloane stops the zombies. But people are angry, scared, and quick to accuse her of misusing magic. Detective Alice Gramarye, Senior Grammar Mage and Sloane’s mentor, revokes Sloane’s access to magic. The news uses her as an example of the risk all magic users pose, and a classmate fans the flames, hoping to get Sloane in enough trouble that Detective Alice will be forced to choose a new apprentice.

No one believes Sloane, and the real villain is still out there. To regain her magic and earn back Alice’s trust, she must discover who tampered with her spell and stop them before they attack again.

THE GRAMMAR MAGE CHRONICLES: THE CASE OF THE CHEESE ZOMBIES is a 55,000-word contemporary middle-grade fantasy with zombies reminiscent of _ParaNorman_ and a plotline similar to Maurice Broaddus’s _The Usual Suspects_.

I hold a master’s degree in philosophy with a focus on the intersections between science and ethics, and I am an avid fantasy reader and writer. My fantasy novel, _Born of Wind and Storm_, placed fifth in the Apprentice category of the 2018 Ink & Insights contest and is listed under Judges’ Favorites.

### First Five Pages
 
Chapter 1

Sloane rolled the cheese into a ball the size of a quarter, covered it with cling wrap, and smashed it flat. She stepped back, one finger pressed to her lips as she studied the blue veins running through the white disc.

“What are you doing?” Ransom dusted off his hands, getting flour all over her mother’s not-for-actual-use kitchen towels. A mortal sin if Sloane did it, but somehow fine when he did.

“Tyromancy.” She pursed her lips, examining one remarkably long streak of blue.

“Okay.” Ransom crossed the kitchen. “What’s tyromancy?”

“The art of telling the future with cheese. Gorgonzola works particularly well. All the veins give me something to focus on.”

“What do you see?” He stopped beside her, his gray eyes staring down at their future.

“Cheese.” She craned her neck back to smile up at him. Why did he have to be so tall? Four-foot-two was enough for any eleven-year-old, but he was a full head taller.

“Right.” He let out a little grunt, something between a laugh and a groan. “What do you see in our future?”

“Let’s see what the cheese says.” She squinted, one finger tracing across the blue veins. “I see…tasty cheese.”

“Anything else?”

“Bad breath.” She wrinkled her nose and pretended to gag.

Laughing, Ransom peeled off the cling wrap and snatched up the disc of cheese. “Tyromancy’s not a real thing is it?”

“Of course not.” Sloane stole a pinch of cheese back and popped it into her mouth. “I mean, some people say it is,” she paused to enjoy the sharp, tangy flavor, “but some people believe in ancient aliens and algebra. People will believe anything.”

“If it’s not _real_, then why are you doing it?” Ransom checked the cheese for any signs of damage then carefully rolled the disk back into a ball.

“Because you are the slowest baker in the world.” Sloane threw her hands up. “Just shove it in the oven already.”

“I’m not a baker. I’m only doing this because you said I have to for the magic to work.” He lumbered across the kitchen and dropped the cheese beside a block of Velveeta and a bowl of dough. “I might be faster if someone stopped playing with the food.”

Sloane followed and leaned past him to poke at the dough. “Looks ready to me.”

“Don’t you have some writing to do or something?” Ransom dipped his fingertips in a bag on the counter and flicked flour at her.

Sloane grumbled. She dusted off her hoodie and shook out her dark brown hair as she walked around the stove to the kitchen table. Give Ransom any task, any challenge, and he would research, worry, take a million years to start, but end up doing something amazing. He never cut corners. He never failed, which Sloane considered quite annoying. Worst of all, he never understood when good enough was plenty. That’s why she wasted half her life waiting around for him to finish things.

She plopped down on the far side of the table, where she could keep an eye on Ransom. Sloane pulled her messy-bits notebook—the one full of all her first drafts and half-finished spells—out of her backpack. Sixth grade at Rhinesville Middle School was simple for most students, but for her, it turned out to be a never-ending stream of writing assignments. Not that she minded. The mage apprenticeship wasn’t an official school program, but most of her teachers did their best to help. After Sloane won the apprenticeship with Detective Alice Gramarye, Senior Grammar Mage at the local police department, most of her assignments changed, letting Sloane focus on what she loved most: writing and magic.

Sloane flipped past her notes for the science fair. Officially, they didn’t start work on their projects until the end of the week, but Sloane had been researching for weeks. Ransom told her about some rice a scientist had modified, cramming in all kinds of vitamins and stuff to keep people from starving. No one used it because it tasted like cardboard and took too much water to grow. She would fix that. A bit of magic and the rice would taste like bacon. Everyone would want to eat it. She had a couple of ideas on the water problem too. Once she solved world hunger, the Council of Mages would have to admit she should be a full mage and not just an apprentice.

A baking sheet clattered as Ransom dropped the first Velveeta-filled ball of dough on it. He picked up the gorgonzola, wrinkling his nose and sniffing it suspiciously.

“I asked at Patty’s restaurant,” he said. “They said to use Velveeta, not blue cheese.”

“Why didn’t you google it?” Sloane clicked the end of her pen over and over.

“Because Patty bakes these all day every day.” His eyes cut to her. “Google doesn’t.”

Fair enough. Patty had worked for the Mt. Diablo school district for years before opening her own place. For all Sloane knew, Ms. Patty had invented the Cheese Zombie. Maybe she was the first cafeteria worker to stick a block of cheese inside a bit of dough and improve school lunches by about a thousand percent. Sure, they were just round rolls filled with cheese, but they were soft and melty and perfectly gooey, and they made even the worst days bearable.

“Yuck.” Ransom pulled his finger out of his mouth and wiped it off on his apron. “Do you have any taste buds?”

“It’s delicious, and I promise the magic needs it.”

His suspicious glare moved from the cheese to her. “Is that Sloane speak for _do what I say or I won’t help_?”

“Yep.” She grinned and shook her head. “You’re the one who wants me to magic-up a horde of zombies, so do what I say or I won’t help.”

Ransom laughed and wrapped the blue cheese inside the dough.

“Excellent.” Sloane turned the page. “Laugh again but like you’re an evil scientist.”

“What? No way.” He shook his head, his mussy, black hair waving across his forehead and over his ears. “That’s embarrassing.”

“Just do it.” Her eyes rolled toward the ceiling. “I promise not to tell anyone.”

He hesitated but did as she asked while Sloane scribbled in her notebook.

_Ransom stares at a dozen cheese zombies stretched out on a cold metal tray. A wicked smile curls his lips. He cackles and slams the oven door. Soon his creations will be complete._

She read the words out loud. Ransom stopped beside the stove, watching as an image rose from the paper like R2-D2’s hologram of Princess Leia, only less fuzzy and in full color.

“Nice.” Ransom grinned, dimples flashing, his voice full of pride. “You’re going to be the best mage in the whole Bay Area someday.”

Her cheeks burned. Sloane waved a hand through the illusion, and it puffed out in little swirls of light. Becoming a mage was only part of the plan. She wanted to be a detective and a witch hunter like Alice.

Witches didn’t follow rules, and they didn’t care who they hurt. The magic didn’t listen to most people, and often, a witch’s victim couldn’t fight back. Aunt Moni always said those who can have to stand up for those who can’t, so Sloane would stand up. She would stop people from misusing magic. But the council didn’t let average mages become witch hunters. She needed to be the best. The best storyteller. The best with magic. The best at solving crimes.

At least with stories and magic, she could practice at home, but Alice still wouldn’t let her work on a real case. Sloane sighed. What a waste of her super sleuthing skills.

The tip of her pen skimmed above the page. She crossed out the words _cheese_ and _complete_, then replaced them with _cheesy_ and _alive_. She went on to describe Ransom as he washed a bowl and cleaned the kitchen. The trick with grammar magic was finding small tweaks that would make a big difference. Words to swap out, commas to delete, things to misspell on purpose.

_Illegally parked vehicles will be towed_.

A bit of tweaking and, _illegally parked vehicles will be toads_.

Sloane could do that. She could turn a car into a toad, but only if she found the right story. People didn’t understand that magic required truths. It liked a change or two. Something fun. Something funny. But most of the story needed to capture reality, so Sloane wrote two full pages. Enough to make sure the magic would accept her changes when she activated the spell.
