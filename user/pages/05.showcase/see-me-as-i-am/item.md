### Query

For seventeen-year-old Jenny Ryan, landing a backstage pass the night her favorite band plays the biggest arena in Portland is a dream come true. And when events throw her and frontman Liam O’Shannon alone together, everything is picture perfect. Or would be, if only she knew it was him. But Jenny is blind, and Liam switches up his Irish accent for a one time shot at being someone else, if only for a few minutes. 

Or maybe two months.
	
Despite her adept skills at living blind in a sighted world, Jenny has no clue the British promotional guy she knows as Jamie Conway—who shows up to hand-deliver a signed t-shirt from the band and calls her with increasing frequency—is the rock star she’s fangirled over the last three years. Opening up to him about the accident that took her sight when she was twelve and her parents’ divorce two years later, Jenny finds herself in a deepening relationship despite her fear it won’t last. Yes, Jamie is caring, but is he up for the drawbacks of a girl who’s blind? What if they fall apart, as her parents did, when things get tough?

Even so, he’s become her dream. Until a show one night at the Tacoma Dome when she learns the truth about him—a truth that shatters everything she’d believed. Now she must find the will to forgive the rock star who used her blindness against her or give him up for good.  

SEE ME AS I AM is a YA contemporary romance that will appeal to fans of _The One Thing_ by Marci Lyn Curtis and _Somewhere Only We Know_ by Maureen Goo. It is complete at 78,000 words.

### First Five Pages

You know that killer thing you can’t imagine ever happening to you? Like, never in a million years happen? And then, impossibly, it does?

Well—it freaking did.

And I’m on adrenaline overload, standing here (loitering, actually) below the stage in Portland’s Moda Center arena after my favorite band of all time—O’Shannon, direct to the U.S. from Cork, Ireland—cleaned up the most epic live show ever. 

It’s totally jammed in here, seventeen-thousand-plus people emptying out above and behind me, seats thudding, feet stomping, everyone talking, stuff getting dragged over the stage floor walled up above me, and my best friend, Morgan Townsend, standing so close her body  heat radiates into mine. 

“Okay, this should be her now,” Morgan says, over the crowd loud enough to be heard. 

My Moda Center contact. The one I don’t hear coming (they’re all coming or going or both) until she stops dead in front of me.

“Jenny Ryan?” she says.

Like I’m the only option in the place.

I blow out the breath I didn’t know I was holding. “Yeah, hi.” I reach out because it’s less awkward for everyone if I make the first move. “I’m Jenny.”

“Carrie Wallace, Guest Services.” She takes my hand, shakes it. “I’ll need to see your photo ID.” 

“Sure.” I reach into the purse slung over my shoulder. It’s smallish, so finding my wallet takes no time. I pull it out, pop it open, flip it to face her. I carry three cards in the plastic slots—my photo ID, my Sandy High Student Body card, and the Visa Mom got me for emergency use only. My ID is always slotted first. 

“Okay, thanks,” she says.   

I close my wallet, stuff it back into my purse.

“This is your pass.” She puts the laminated card in my hand. It hits the waistband of my jeans when I pull the lanyard over my head. “I’ll take you in and bring you out. You’ll have access to one room for about twenty minutes.” 

“Okay.” The nerves I shoved down earlier are jangling again in my stomach. 

Morgan cuts in. “Any chance I can come with?”

“I’m sorry,” Carrie says. “Some acts are more flexible than others, but for this one, I’m only authorized to take Jenny in.” 

“I do a great guide dog impersonation,” says Morgan.

“I’d let you if I could.” Carrie’s voice lifts with that extra bit of cheeriness you don’t get from someone with a straight face. She moves in beside me. “You can take my arm, if you like.”

I’ve got my cane, folded inside my jacket pocket, but jarring as it is in here—all echoes on echoes, noise and confusion—I’m going to need an assist from somebody with working eyes. 

Most the time that’s Alexis. I actually _do_ have a guide dog. But working her isn’t always practical. Like in tight-quartered stadium seating for brutally loud rock concerts.

Carrie pulls my hand through her elbow like she’s been trained on what to do. 

“Sorry,” I say to Morgan. 

She sighs hugely so no one misses the point. “No biggie.”

Of course, it’s a mondo deal to her because she’s totally into Kyle Finnegan (aka Kyle Finn), O’Shannon lead guitarist, and she spent days going over what she was going to say if, by some unthinkable miracle—like the one staring me in the face—she got the chance to meet him.

“We’ll be at the south exit in half an hour,” Carrie says over the top of my five-foot-flat.

“Sure.” To me, Morgan says, “If you meet Kyle—” 

“I know.” 

I’ve got her ticket for autographing, just in case. 

“Good luck. Have fun.” Her voice leaks so much I-wish-it-was-me I feel bad going off and leaving her here. “Tell him hi for me.”

_If_ I get to meet him.	

I’d rather meet Liam.

Kyle’s phenomenal, don’t get me wrong. But Liam is, well, to put it bluntly—earth-shattering.

And I’ve been a huge fan ever since he took over as frontman from his older brother Michael O’Shannon, who bowed out to act as producer and manager. The band’s been around five years, but nobody—unless they live in Ireland, the UK, or continental Europe—had really heard of them until Liam got the mike in hand. Suddenly everyone was downloading them off iTunes, cueing them up on Spotify, and looking for tickets online when the band announced they were jumping the Pond to tour the U.S. for the first time ever.

Morgan and I bought ours the day Ticketmaster put them up for presale. Not the VIP packages that came with close in seating, O’Shannon merch, and a Q & A with the band in the arena, but second tier seats we could actually afford. And while front row—_sitting_ here, not just waiting to meet somebody—would have been to die for, it’s not like _I_ was going to see anything being down any closer.

Carrie hauls me off, leaving Morgan behind.

“How was everything tonight?” she asks.

“Incredible.” 

O’Shannon is just _so_ good, innovative and edgy and theatrical (so I hear). Yeah, they do some Celtic stuff, all high-powered and blistering loud. But mostly they’re hardcore rock—lots of heavy guitar work and synthy strings and a razor-edged vocalist who’s dead on for cuts like _Fallen_ and _Me Without You_ and _Tear at the Walls_. 

And don’t get Morgan started on the light show. She said it was more spectacular than the Fourth of July. 

Carrie takes me through a curtained exit and into a corridor. Walls close in, echoes compress, and up ahead another corridor runs crossways, full of voices and feet falling on cement. She stops several strides in, opens a door, pulls me through.

Small room, mostly empty. 

Trust me, I can tell.

“You know someone from the band?” she asks.

I shake my head. “I wrote to O’Shannon Productions and asked if there was any chance of meeting somebody after the show.”

“And they said _yes_?” She sounds amazed.

“They did.”

Not that it was as easy as all that. 

I wrote before the tour dates were posted. Sent an actual letter, not an email, printed on watermarked paper. Fine-tuned every sentence and pitched them for maximum attention grab. Used my age (seventeen) and my year in high school (senior), my interest in journalism (I write for my school newspaper and am doing a story on the event), and my plans for college in the fall (University of Oregon). Threw out the blind card (it can be an asset at times) and added my blog site (_BlindSight_) in case anyone cared to know more, along with complete contact info. Enclosed a return envelope already stamped with the correct Ireland-to-U.S. postage.

Six weeks later, I got an answer.

They said no.

Well, not the band. I doubt they even saw my letter.

This was from some office guru who thanked me for writing and politely told me sorry, no-can-do before taglining we hope you enjoy the show. 

Pretty much what I’d expected. 

Morgan and I bought our tickets. It was mid-June, and we had four months to wait. 

Then halfway through September, this showed up in the mail:    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Dear Jenny Ryan,_ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Someone passed your letter on to me, and I’ve read it with_ </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_interest. I’ve looked at your blog site, and I’ve talked this over_ </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_with the band’s manager, Michael O’Shannon. He authorized_ </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_me to grant you limited backstage privileges (including a brief_ </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_interview with one of our people) at the Portland show in October._</br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I will make all necessary arrangements with the venue, and_</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_someone will contact you prior to the event._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Wishing you all the best,_	

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Jameson Conway_</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_O’Shannon Productions_

Just like that, I was in.

And now that I literally _am_ in, I can barely breathe.

Because if Liam walks through that door and says hi to me in his to-die-for Irish brogue, it’ll take everything I’ve got to keep my composure from bolting out behind him.
