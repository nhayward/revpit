### Welcome to the newly created #RevPit!

We editors found ourselves with the same block open in our schedules and decided to put that time to good use by offering our services to authors via a pitch contest in the hopes that everyone who follows along could learn something worthwhile and make meaningful connections along the way.

In this contest, authors will be eligible to receive feedback and full edits on their manuscript from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for those agent inboxes. Not only will authors be immersed in a supportive community of their peers, they will also have the chance to learn more about how their story fits into the industry and obtain understanding of why different edits matter and how to continue practicing them in the future.

Writers will submit their query and first five pages to their top three editors and one alternate, who will then go through submissions and select one (or two!) winners. These matches will go through an intense, month-long editing process before reposting their submissions from finalized projects.

**What You’ll Need:**

1. \#RevPit is only open to COMPLETED manuscripts. It should be polished and beta-reader-tested before submission.

2. A query letter containing: word count, genre, age category, and author bio.

3. A synopsis no more than two pages long. You do NOT have to include this in your submission package. However, most editors prefer having one if they request more pages from you. It’s best to already have it prepared.

4. The answer to these three questions!
 * Why do you write?
 * On a scale of 1-10, how much tough love do you like in your revision feedback? (10 = Bring it on!)
 * Pro or Anti Oxford comma?
