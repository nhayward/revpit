### Welcome to Revise & Resub!

**Revise & Resub (#RevPit)** is a Twitter writing community co-founded in 2017 by a group of editors. It supports authors by offering editing-focused chats and mini-events throughout the year as well as an annual contest wherein querying authors can win feedback and edits on their full manuscripts from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for agent inboxes.

The #RevPit 2018 Annual Contest Begins **April 21st**! See the [Annual Contest page](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest) for more details. Visit our [Mini-Events page](http://reviseresub.com/mini-events) for updates on workshops, chats, mini-contests, and more!

The #RevPit editors have created a Reedsy Learning course on practical tips for revising your novel. Learn more and sign up [here](https://blog.reedsy.com/learning/courses/writing/novel-revision-practical-tips-rewrites?target=_blank).
