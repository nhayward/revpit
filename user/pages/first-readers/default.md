## Welcome Potential First Readers!

This year, in order to make our submission process more accessible for the #RevPit community, we’re making the following changes:

1. We’re removing the submission limit so that editors will receive all the submissions directed their way during the submission window.
2. We’re expanding the submission window to cover three full days so that people in all time zones and with work and other commitments won’t be disadvantaged in submitting.
3. We’re expanding the number of editors authors can select to three (instead of two) so authors have one more opportunity for an editor to fall in love with their submission.

First Readers are an integral part of making this possible by providing editors additional information to help them pick which story is best for them.

#### What Do First Readers Do?

First Readers will read and evaluate the first five pages of each submission assigned to them. Each may receive up to 100 submissions within their chosen genre(s) and age category(s). Content warnings will also be considered. Please plan up to 20 hours over the two-week window. Please note: First Readers are not eligible to enter the annual contest the year they act as First Reader but may enter in future years.

You will receive training on how to evaluate the submissions, and there will be a report card allocated to each reader that looks at three main categories:
1. Connection the the main character
2. Writing style (craft: conflict and tension, show don’t tell, grammar)
3. Narrative voice/POV

#### What’s In It For Me? (WIIFM)

Our group of professional editors will be offering multiple free online courses to all our First Readers. Our First Reader group will be polled to ensure the content offered is reflective of what’s in-demand. These could range anywhere from how to become a freelance editor, how to format a manuscript, or even how to edit your manuscript through use of macros. Of course, if there is demand, courses will be created on writing and style craft.

The purpose of these courses is to better position our readers in the industry, so they might grow their own businesses and editorial savvy.
