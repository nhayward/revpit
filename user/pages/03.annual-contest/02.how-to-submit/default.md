**Step 3:** Answer the following questions in the provided space:

 * Why did you choose these editors as the best match for you and your manuscript?

**Step 4:** Attach the first five double-spaced pages (approximately 1250-1500 words) of your manuscript. 

**Step 5:** Have a synopsis and additional pages ready in case an editor requests more! Requests for additional materials may be made as early as the first day of the submission window.

**Step 6:** SUBMIT!

##### Eligibility Requirements:

 * Your submission materials are your own original work
 * The manuscript you are submitting has never been published before
 * You are not represented by a literary agent
 * No projects under 25,000 words (including poetry, chapter books, and picture books) or non-fiction

###### Please note: If you are selected for Revise & Resub, your query and first five pages will be showcased on our website at the end of the contest. We want to be able to share your hard work with the world! Revised submissions will be showcased for three months and then removed from the site. After three months, or upon securing agent representation or a publishing contract, an author may request their submission be taken out of the showcase.
