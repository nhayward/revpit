### The #RevPit 2023 Annual Contest Begins March 16th!

In this contest, authors are eligible to receive developmental edits on their **full fiction manuscript** from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for agents. Authors will be immersed in a supportive community of their peers and have the chance to learn more about how their story fits into the industry and why different edits matter and how to continue practicing them in the future.
 
See our [Contest Schedule](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/schedule) for a breakdown of contest dates.
 
_Note: Non-fiction, poetry, chapter books, picture books, and projects under 25,000 words are not eligible._
