##### _Our submission window is currently closed. _

### The #RevPit 2019 Annual Contest Begins April 6th!

In this contest, authors will be eligible to receive feedback and developmental edits on their **full fiction manuscript** from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for those agent inboxes. Not only will authors be immersed in a supportive community of their peers, they will also have the chance to learn more about how their story fits into the industry and obtain understanding of why different edits matter and how to continue practicing them in the future.

See our [Contest Schedule](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/schedule) for a breakdown of dates involving the contest.

###### _Note: No projects under 25,000 words (including poetry, chapter books, and picture books) or non-fiction will be accepted._

#### How It Works

Writers must choose two editors and one alternate. [The editors](http://reviseresub.com/editors) have listed what age categories and genres they’re accepting and will hold #AskEditor twitter chats to help writers decide who might be a good fit. This is your opportunity to ask your top choices anything!

Once the submission window opens, writers will use Submittable to submit query letter and first five double-spaced pages (1250-1500 words) to their top two editors and one alternate. Only **one** submission per entrant. Check out the [How to Submit page](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/how-to-submit) to learn about the submission process.

When the submission window closes, editors will read all entries. Watch your chosen editors’ tweets and the #RevPit feed, as all editors will tweet anonymous [#10queries](https://katiemccoach.com/how-an-editor-sees-it-10queries?target=_blank) feedback as they go. Editors will then select one (or two!) winners and a runner-up to receive [prizes](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/prizes). The winning author-editor pairs will go through an intense, month-long editing process before posting their revised query letters and first five pages to the showcase on the Revise & Resub blog. Runners-up will each receive a separate [prize](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/prizes). 

#### What You’ll Need:

1. \#RevPit is only open to COMPLETED fiction manuscripts. It should be polished and beta-reader-tested before submission. Editors may request your complete manuscript as early as the first day of the submission window. Manuscripts should be in Word doc format, double-spaced, with one-inch margins and a standard font (Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman, 11 or 12 pt). 
2. A query letter containing: word count, genre, age category, book description, and author bio. Query letter should be in Word doc format, single-spaced, with one-inch margins and a standard font (Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman, 11 or 12 pt). Check out our [Sample Query](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest/sample-query).
3. A synopsis no more than two pages (1000 words) long. Do NOT include this in your submission package. However, many editors may request a synopsis from you with your other submission materials. It’s best to already have it prepared. The synopsis should be in Word doc format, single-spaced, with one-inch margins and a standard font (Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman, 11 or 12 pt). Never written a synopsis? [Here’s how](http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/mastering-dreaded-synopsis?target=_blank).
4. Your top **two** choices for [editors](http://reviseresub.com/editors) to submit to, plus **one** alternate. Your submission will only go to your alternate choice if one of your top two have already received the maximum number of submissions allowed per editor when we process your submission.
5. The answer to these three questions:
 * Why do you write?
 * On a scale of 1-10, how much tough love do you like in your revision feedback? (10 = Bring it on!)
 * Why did you choose these editors as the best match for you and your manuscript?
