![RevPit Grand Prize](RevPit_GrandPrize.jpg)

Entrants of our [Annual Contest](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest) have the opportunity to win feedback and developmental edits on their **full** manuscript from one of our [professional editors](http://reviseresub.com/editors).

Our professional editors have donated generous amounts of time in order to help you get your manuscript as polished as possible. You win **8 weeks** of our editors’ developmental editing expertise.

For the Annual Contest, we define a developmental edit as an editorial letter (or equivalent) and consultation (via whatever means of communication editor and author agree upon). The editor will also help the author prepare a query letter edit and first five pages for the winner showcase.

Any additional edits will be up to the author's and editor's discretion and follow a mutually agreed upon timeline.

Developmental editing includes (but is not limited to) story-arc, character development, structure, flow, and voice. Winners will also have access to discuss their manuscripts, ask questions about how to approach revisions, and receive advice from their editors. This type of editing can be worth upwards of _a thousand dollars_, and grand prize winners will receive it for free.

Should you win, the editor that picks you will help you with what your manuscript needs most. Every manuscript will have different needs to get it agent-ready by the showcase stage. 

## Runners-up Prizes

#### Premium Query Critique

Michelle is offering a query critique to all the runners-up! A premium query letter critique includes two rounds of feedback to help get your query letter ready to submit to agents or publishers.

#### First Chapter Critique

with [Nicole Frail](http://www.nicolefrail.com/about?target=_blank)

Nicole is offering a first-chapter critique (up to ten pages) to each of this season's #RevPit runners-up! This could be a critique of the manuscript submitted for #RevPit or another WIP. Each critique will receive comments in the document as well as a short editorial letter about the opening of your manuscript.

#### Group Coaching Session

with [Katie McCoach](https://reviseresub.com/editors/katie-mccoach)

Katie is offering three group-coaching sessions for our runner-up winners! Sessions will take place once a month starting after winners are announced via Zoom. Each runner-up will have a chance to be featured (along with 2-3 others) during one of the sessions in which Katie will provide direct feedback back on your submission materials and answer your specific project questions on the call. You’ll be able to attend any or all three sessions. Katie highly encourages each runner-up to attend as many sessions as possible to benefit from the group aspect and learn from your fellow writers. This is also a great opportunity to build your writer community!
