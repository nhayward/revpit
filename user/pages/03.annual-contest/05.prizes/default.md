Entrants of our [Annual Contest](http://reviseresub.com/annual-contest) have the opportunity to win feedback and developmental edits on their **full** manuscript from one of our [professional editors](http://reviseresub.com/editors).

Our professional editors have donated generous amounts of time in order to help you get your manuscript as polished as possible. You win **8 weeks** of our editorsâ€™ developmental editing expertise.

For the Annual Contest, we define a developmental edit as an editorial letter (or equivalent) and consultation (via whatever means of communication editor and author agree upon). The editor will also help the author prepare a query letter edit and first five pages for the winner showcase.

Any additional edits will be up to the author's and editor's discretion and follow a mutually agreed upon timeline.

Developmental editing includes (but is not limited to) story-arc, character development, structure, flow, and voice. Winners will also have access to discuss their manuscripts, ask questions about how to approach revisions, and receive advice from their editors. This type of editing can be worth upwards of _a thousand dollars_, and grand prize winners will receive it for free.

Should you win, the editor that picks you will help you with what your manuscript needs most. Every manuscript will have different needs to get it agent-ready by the showcase stage.
