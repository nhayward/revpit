Our annual RevPit contest in the spring of this year was one of the best ones yet. We introduced more editors to the RevPit community, and helped tons of authors develop their work. With the fun of summer over and the coziness of Autumn upon us, it seems high time we held one of our favorite mini events: 10Queries! 
 
If you’ve been around the community, you know what this is already, but to those who are new, the #10Queries Mini Event is a content where writers submit their query letter and first 5 pages of their manuscript for professional editor feedback (via Twitter)! 
 
This event will take place **October 18th, 2019 - October 25th**.
 
Find out if your query and first 5 pages have what it takes to stand out and hook an editor’s/agent’s/reader’s attention! 
 
In this event, writers will enter their names in a random drawing via Rafflecopter. If they are selected, their query and first five pages will be randomly assigned to an editor who will then tweet about the submission using #10Queries. Winners will not know which editor received their submissions until after the #10Queries tweets have been posted.
 
Tweets will consist of brief feedback based on the editors' first impressions of the winners' queries and first five pages. Not familiar with #10Queries? Learn more here: [How an Editor Sees It (#10queries)](http://katiemccoach.com/how-an-editor-sees-it-10queries?target=_blank)
 
Writers must have a complete query letter and first 5 pages of manuscript in order to enter but will not submit these materials unless their name is drawn.
 
Writers may enter the drawing Friday, October 18th until 11:59 PM EST. They may enter their names multiple times via Rafflecopter, but their name can only be drawn once. 
 
This event is separate from the main #RevPit contest in April. For this #10queries event, winners will not receive a full edit.

#### Schedule:

 * **Friday, October 18th:** Contest drawing opens for writers. Writers will enter through Rafflecopter (access at the bottom of the page. It will not be active until Oct. 18th). 
    * The drawing will close at 11:59pm, Eastern time on Friday. 
    * To be eligible to win, writers can only enter through Rafflecopter.
 * **Saturday, October 19th:** Winners will be notified via email. They will then be asked to send their query/five pages to the RevPit email account. 
 * Winners must email their materials to the Revise & Resub email address no later than **11:00AM EST on Monday the 21st**. In order to provide enough time for editors to read all materials, no late submissions will be accepted.
 * **Monday, October 21st – Thursday, October 24th:** Editors will review the submission packages.
 * **Friday, October 25th:** Editors will share their #10queries throughout the day! They will tweet from **9am EST - 7pm EST**. Winners will not be named in the tweets. Editors will email writers separately to notify which #10Queries tweet was theirs.
 
Participation from all contestants is encouraged. Even if your name isn’t drawn in the raffle, you can learn so much from the #10queries tweets.
