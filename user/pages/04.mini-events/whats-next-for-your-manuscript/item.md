### What’s Next for Your Manuscript? 

The Revise & Resub editors strive to foster a community centered on helping authors get their manuscripts ready for agent inboxes. With the Annual Contest in full swing, we’ve curated a list of options to help with your next steps on the path to publication.

#### Critique Partners (CPs)
Our best advice to help see your writing more analytically is to read and critique other authors’ writing as much as you can. 

Some tips for getting started giving and receiving critiques: [www.standoutbooks.com](https://www.standoutbooks.com/good-critique-partners?target=_blank) 

There’s a Facebook group that was started by RevPit authors in 2018 and continues to thrive. It’s a great place to connect with others in the RevPit community and also find critique partners.  Check it out [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/207036893360574?target=_blank)

The Rewrite It Club is an online community that helps encourage writers as they dive into deep and thorough revisions for their stories. They also run a group for authors where you can meet potential CPs. Check it out [here](http://rewriteitclub.com?target=_blank)

CP Match occasionally runs events on Twitter with the intent of helping authors find new critique partners. Their next event is April 27, 2019. Details [here](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPMatch?src=hash)

#### Structure

Author Jami Gold has created worksheets to help writers with structure (and also writing craft and critiquing). Check them out [here]( https://jamigold.com/for-writers/worksheets-for-writers?target=_blank)

[This article](https://www.nownovel.com/blog/7-ways-write-plot-outline?target=_blank) has a great breakdown of common approaches to novel structures. These are often used in the planning phase but can be just as helpful after the first (or second or third) draft.
