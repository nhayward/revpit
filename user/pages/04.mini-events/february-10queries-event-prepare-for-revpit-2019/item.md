Are you readying your manuscript to query agents? Are you preparing for this year’s RevPit event? What better way to know if your query and first 5 pages have what it takes to stand out in the slush pile than to get an editor’s eye on it? As editors, we offer a professional perspective with insight into ways to improve your work.

In preparation for the #revpit annual contest in April, we are hosting a bonus #10Queries event, **February 8th - February 15th, 2019**.

In this event, writers will enter their names in a random drawing via Rafflecopter. If they are selected, their query and first five pages will be randomly assigned to an editor who will then tweet about the submission using #10Queries. Winners will not know which editor received their submissions until after the #10Queries tweets have been posted.
 
Tweets will consist of brief feedback based on the editors' first impressions of the winners' queries and first five pages. Not familiar with #10Queries? Learn more here: [How an Editor Sees It (#10queries)](http://katiemccoach.com/how-an-editor-sees-it-10queries?target=_blank)
 
Writers must have a complete query letter and first 5 pages of manuscript in order to enter but will not submit these materials unless their name is drawn.
 
Writers may enter the drawing **Friday, February 8th _until_ 11:59 PM**. They may enter their names multiple times via Rafflecopter, but their name can only be drawn once. 
 
_**This event is separate from the main #RevPit contest in April. For this #10queries event, winners will not receive a full edit.**_

#### Schedule:

 * Friday, February 8th: Contest drawing opens for writers. Writers will enter through Rafflecopter (access at the bottom of the page. It will not be active until February 8th). 
     * The drawing will close at 11:59pm, Eastern time on Friday. 
     * To be eligible to win, writers can only enter through Rafflecopter.
 * Saturday, February 9th: Winners will be notified via email. They will then be asked to send their query/five pages to the RevPit email account. 
 * Winners must email their materials to the Revise & Resub email address no later than 11:00AM EST on Monday the 11th. In order to provide enough time for editors to read all materials, **no late submissions will be accepted**.
 * Monday, February 11th – Thursday, February 14th: Editors will review the submission packages.
 * Friday, February 15th: Editors will share their #10queries throughout the day! Winners will not be named in the tweets. Editors will email writers separately to notify which #10Queries tweet was theirs.
 
Participation from all contestants is encouraged. Even if your name isn’t drawn in the raffle, you can learn so much from the #10queries tweets.
 
#### #10Queries Schedule:
**All times are listed in Eastern Time on Friday, February 15th**
