Are you readying your manuscript to query agents? Are you preparing for this year’s RevPit event? What better way to know if your query and first 5 pages have what it takes to stand out in the slush pile than to get an editor’s eye on it? As editors, we offer a professional perspective with insight into ways to improve your work.

We are hosting a #10Queries event, **October 13th - October 27th**.
 
Find out if your query and first 5 pages have what it takes to stand out and hook an editor’s/agent’s/reader’s attention! 
 
In this event, writers will enter their names in a random drawing via Rafflecopter. If they are selected, their query and first five pages will be randomly assigned to an editor who will then post about the submission using the [10Queries] tag on our [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RevPit?target=_blank). Winners will not know which editor received their submissions until after the 10Queries posts have been posted.
 
Posts will consist of brief feedback based on the editors' first impressions of the winners' queries and first five pages. 
 
Writers must have a complete query letter and first 5 pages of manuscript in order to enter but will not submit these materials unless their name is drawn.
 
Writers may enter the drawing Friday, October 13th until 11:59 PM Eastern. They may enter their names multiple times via Rafflecopter, but their name can only be drawn once. 
 
###### This event is separate from the main #RevPit contest in the spring. For this #10queries event, winners will not receive a full edit.

#### Schedule:

 * **Friday, October 13th:** Contest drawing opens for writers. Writers will enter through Rafflecopter (access at the bottom of the page. It will not be active until Oct 13th). 
    * The drawing will close at 11:59pm, Eastern time on Friday. 
    * To be eligible to win, writers can only enter through Rafflecopter.
 * **Saturday, October 14th:** Winners will be notified via email. They will then be asked to submit their query/five pages to a RevPit Google form. 
 * Winners must submit their materials to the Revise & Resub email address no later than **11:00AM EST on Wednesday the 18th**. In order to provide enough time for editors to read all materials, no late submissions will be accepted.
 * **Wednesday, October 18th - Friday, October 27th:** Editors will review the submission packages.
 * **Friday, October 27th:** Editors will share their #10queries throughout the day! They will post from **9am EST - 9pm EST**. Winners will not be named in the posts. Editors will email writers separately to notify which #10Queries post was theirs.
 
Participation from all contestants is encouraged. Even if your name isn’t drawn in the raffle, you can learn so much from the 10Queries posts.
