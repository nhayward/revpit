##### Tune in at 12PM EST for a webinar with a few of your favorite RevPit editors!! 

In this webinar, we will have a panel with some of the RevPit editors. These questions come direct from authors who “won” our NaNoWriMo event last November. 

##### The editors will answer questions such as...

===

 * How to tackle revisions of the first draft when it feels like your about to climb Mount Everest
 * How to structure a query letter, especially when you have multiple POVs in your story
 * Tips for fantasy authors on world building and magic systems 
 * And what the editors wish authors would ask themselves when they are revising a manuscript
