### JOIN US FOR CAMP! CAMP REVPIT STARTS OCTOBER 18!

Have you ever gone on a camp retreat and felt that spark of rejuvenation? Whether you attended as a kid or an adult, there’s something magical about turning off your life for a few precious moments and rediscovering your passion.

When you’re not chosen for a contest, a mentorship, or if you’re sitting on an inbox full of story rejections, it can begin to weigh you down. These moments often come with self-doubt, hesitation, or feelings of dejection. But you are not alone&mdash;and the RevPit community is here to help.

### Welcome to #CampRevPit!

Under the #RevPit flag, our RevPit winners and runner-up alumni want to recapture that camp spirit and help writers rediscover their writing passion. We are on a mission to support the #RevPit community with new opportunities to find feedback, encouragement, and writer buddies that could turn into lifelong partnerships&mdash;along with some fun Twitter games to keep the sun shining through the dark clouds.

#### So what is [#CampRevPit](https://www.jenichappelleeditorial.com/blog/search/.hash.camprevpit?target=_blank)?

Unlike other #RevPit events, #CampRevPit is author-led by our team of Camp Counselors, made up of previous RevPit alumni and volunteers from the community. Our goal is to offer an opportunity for every struggling writer to get the support they need, regardless of where you are in your journey.  

Huge thanks to the #RevPit alumni helping to organize! 

 * Noreen [@noreenlekhak](https://twitter.com/noreenlekhak?target=_blank) Camp Co-Director
 * K. J. Harrowick [@KJHarrowick](https://twitter.com/kjharrowick?target=_blank) Camp Co-Director 
 * Laura Wareck [@LauraMWareck](https://twitter.com/lauramwareck?target=_blank) Head Workshop Counselor
 * Ella Stainton [@astarte73](https://twitter.com/astarte73?target=_blank) Head Team Building Counselor
 * L. Jo King [@JoKingWriter](https://twitter.com/jokingwriter?target=_blank) Head Game Counselor & Social Media Manager

Our camp has three sections, and you’re welcome to join any&mdash;or all! 

##### PROMPTS AND GAMES

Follow the [#CampRevPit](https://www.jenichappelleeditorial.com/blog/search/.hash.camprevpit?target=_blank) hashtag to play along with Twitter games and writing prompts throughout each week! [Click here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CampRevPit&src=typeahead_click) to take you straight to the hashtag.

##### CABINS

The Camp RevPit Cabins group DM chats on Twitter. You’ll be matched up with other writers and have your very own Cabin Counselor to support each other, run writing sprints (or crawls!) with, and hopefully make some new writing friends.

##### FEEDBACK GROUPS

Looking for an extra set of eyes on your query package, or maybe you need a boost of confidence that your pages are doing something right? We will match you with other writers in the same age category and genre, and you and your partner will decide the best way for you to swap materials (email? Google drive?). Please note that you will be both receiving and giving feedback. 

Camp RevPit offers three styles of feedback: 

 * Query Critiques
 * First Page Critiques
 * Positivity Pass

What's a Positivity Pass? It is a critique without the negative. You and your partner will provide only comments on all the amazing things about each other’s pages. You can learn all about it [here](https://www.katiegoldingbooks.com/single-post/2018/12/05/A-New-Kind-of-Beta-Reader?target=_blank) at Katie Golding’s website.

#### So how do I join?
