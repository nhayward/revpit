#### A new RevPit mini-event!

In November, RevPit is hosting Fall into Fiction, a new mini-event to provide support, accountability, and a welcoming, inclusive community for fiction writers who are drafting a novel this fall. 

Our editors have put together an incredible calendar to help keep you writing all month, including:
* [A place](https://www.reddit.com/r/RevPit?target=_blank) to post your fall writing goal and find accountability partners
* Multiple hosted writing sprints each week on Zoom
* Writing inspiration and tips by the RevPit editors
* Live group Zoom brainstorming sessions
* Discussions about genres, age categories, current books, trends, tropes, and story beats
* Opportunities to find critique partners and new writing pals
* Memes and writing humor


It kicks off **October 28** in the [RevPit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RevPit?target=_blank). Anyone can participate in the discussions and threads in the subreddit. You will need a Reddit account. To keep the Zoom meetings safe and secure, participants **must** [sign up](https://reviseresub.substack.com/p/fall-into-fiction?target=_blank) to access the live Zoom writing sprints and/or brainstorming sessions.
