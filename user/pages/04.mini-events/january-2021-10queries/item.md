Are you readying your manuscript to query agents? Are you preparing for this year’s RevPit event? What better way to know if your query and first 5 pages have what it takes to stand out in the slush pile than to get an editor’s eye on it? As editors, we offer a professional perspective with insight into ways to improve your work.

We are hosting a #10Queries event, **January 15th -  January 29th**.
 
Find out if your query and first 5 pages have what it takes to stand out and hook an editor’s/agent’s/reader’s attention! 
 
In this event, writers will enter their names in a random drawing via Rafflecopter. If they are selected, their query and first five pages will be randomly assigned to an editor who will then tweet about the submission using #10Queries. Winners will not know which editor received their submissions until after the #10Queries tweets have been posted.
 
Tweets will consist of brief feedback based on the editors' first impressions of the winners' queries and first five pages. Not familiar with #10Queries? Learn more here: [How an Editor Sees It (#10queries)](http://katiemccoach.com/how-an-editor-sees-it-10queries?target=_blank)
 
Writers must have a complete query letter and first 5 pages of manuscript in order to enter but will not submit these materials unless their name is drawn.
 
Writers may enter the drawing Friday, January 15th until 11:59 PM EST. They may enter their names multiple times via Rafflecopter, but their name can only be drawn once. 
 
###### This event is separate from the main #RevPit contest in the spring. For this #10queries event, winners will not receive a full edit.

#### Schedule:

 * **Friday, January 15th:** Contest drawing opens for writers. Writers will enter through Rafflecopter (access at the bottom of the page. It will not be active until Jan 15th). 
    * The drawing will close at 11:59pm, Eastern time on Friday. 
    * To be eligible to win, writers can only enter through Rafflecopter.
 * **Saturday, January 16th:** Winners will be notified via email. They will then be asked to send their query/five pages to the RevPit email account. 
 * Winners must email their materials to the Revise & Resub email address no later than **11:00AM EST on Wednesday the 20th**. In order to provide enough time for editors to read all materials, no late submissions will be accepted.
 * **Wednesday, January 20th - Friday, January 29th:** Editors will review the submission packages.
 * **Friday, January 29th:** Editors will share their #10queries throughout the day! They will tweet from **9am EST - 9pm EST**. Winners will not be named in the tweets. Editors will email writers separately to notify which #10Queries tweet was theirs.
 
Participation from all contestants is encouraged. Even if your name isn’t drawn in the raffle, you can learn so much from the #10queries tweets.
