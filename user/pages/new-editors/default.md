## RevPit Editors Open Call

Accepting applications June 10th - June 27th.

#### Who Are We?

Revise & Resub (#RevPit) is a writing community co-founded in 2017 by a group of editors. It supports authors by offering editing-focused chats and mini-events throughout the year as well as an annual contest wherein querying authors can win feedback and edits on their full manuscripts from professional editors, ensuring their works are polished and ready for agent inboxes.

#### What Our Editors Do

* Developmental/content edit of one full-length manuscript. Review query letter with the author. 
* Engage in various social media sessions throughout the contest where authors can ask questions and see your expertise/style/personality
* Engage frequently with writers and editors on the RevPit SubReddit and social media during the annual contest period 
* Abide by our #RevPit Code of Conduct.
* Participate in our optional 10Queries mini-event in October (also on our RevPit SubReddit)

#### What’s in It for Me? (WIIFM)

RevPit offers our editors an unmatched level of connection with the writing community, support, and opportunities to showcase your professional skills. As a RevPit Editor, you’ll connect with writers during the annual contest and via mini-events throughout the rest of the year designed to foster a sense of community. This will give you opportunities to network with writers on a one-on-one basis so they can experience your editorial skills. To see what writers have to say about our work, check out the RevPit [testimonials](/testimonials).

In addition, you’ll become part of a team of editors who support each other not only during the annual contest but all year round: we share freelancing and publishing news, tips, and ideas; provide client referrals; and act as a support system as we all navigate our unique paths through the quirks of the freelance editing business.

#### What Are We Looking for in an Editor?

We seek to add editors to our team who have a positive online presence and who are:
* currently interested in expanding their editing careers,
* enthusiastic about supporting the online writing community by volunteering their time and expertise for the contest,
* have at least two years of developmental editing experience,
* charge professional rates for their editing services approaching the EFA rate guidelines, and
* willing and able to meet all the expectations and commitments

In addition to a good fit, we’re also hoping to find editors who can work with genres and age categories for which we have gaps with our current slate of editors (like Middle Grades and Book Club/Women's Fiction).

#### What Is the Timeframe?

We are accepting applications June 10 - June 27 and will be in touch with applicants in August.

Finalists will be asked to participate in our October 10Queries event as a last step in our application process and will know by November whether they are invited to join the RevPit team for the 2025 Annual Contest.

The 2025 Annual Contest is scheduled for April 2025.

#### What Information Is Requested in the Editor Application Form?

* Information about your editing experience, including how joining the RevPit family of editors aligns with your goals for your editing business
* What age categories (middle grades, young adult, and/or adult) you would want to work with and with what genres (large category genres: fantasy, historical, mystery, etc.)
* Editing sample – we have a sample query letter and 1,000 word sample manuscript pages, and we’re asking potential editors to write a brief edit letter and manuscript edits to demonstrate their editing skills and style
