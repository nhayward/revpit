  content: "##### Bio\r\n\r\nAdah Beatrice is a professional freelance editor, team member at Tessera Editorial, agent assistant at Andrea Brown Literary Agency, and 100% INFJ. She likes to compare her editorial style to a chainsaw… But that’s really a humorous attempt at explaining how decisive her edits tend to be—honing in on all those details of character and plot, uncovering stones unturned and paths not yet taken, and painstakingly polishing every story to be the very best. (\"Like no one ever was...\" If you get that reference, you're awesome.)\r\n\r\nWith years of experience across the whole book industry—trade publishing, book retail, freelance, and the wonderful world of literary agents—she has a wealth of knowledge to share and an eagerness to bring new stories and voices to light.\r\n\r\n**Pronouns: She/Her**\r\n\r\n##### MSWL\r\n\r\nObviously, I adore all kinds of stories. But for this contest, I would love for my inbox to be filled to the brim with YA and MG manuscripts. Most genres are fine by me, and I would be thrilled for some genre-bending stories too. There are a few things I’ll be wishing for, but feel free to submit even if your story doesn’t include them. There are also things I won’t be accepting, so please take a close look below!\r\n\r\n**I’m Wishing For:**\r\n * Twists I never, in a million years, see coming\r\n * Spooky middle grade!! (bonus points if you really scare me, which isn’t that difficult)\r\n * Witty banter; the wittiest, truly\r\n * Laugh out loud antics\r\n * Sibling stories! The good, the bad, the firebending battles for supremacy, all of them\r\n * Enemies-to-lovers romance\r\n * The storm cloud x the cinnamon roll romance\r\n * A love interest/MC who bakes their feelings\r\n * Narratives heavily based in mythology or folklore (bonus points for #OwnVoices!)\r\n * Fairytale retellings, especially if they follow the original loosely and/or offer a totally new perspective\r\n * High fantasies with intricate world building, but done so smoothly that I never see the world being built, I’m just immediately immersed\r\n * Third person POV with a narrator who’s as much a character as the actual characters\r\n * Ensemble casts (bonus points for a bromance)\r\n * Asexual representation\r\n\r\n**I Don’t Want:**\r\n * Stories prominently featuring people who are bullies (this is always a no for me)\r\n * Time travel narratives (just for this contest)\r\n * Historical fiction (just for this contest)\r\n\r\n##### Q&A\r\n\r\n**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**\r\n\r\nIf that first line makes me say “aww snap,” or if the opening event is just off-the-wall bonkers, I'll be diving in like it's water and I'm parched. Other than that, what really hooks me are the characters. If their voices are stellar, read aloud flawlessly, and they have intriguing aspects of their personality on display from the get-go, I’ll be saying “aww snap” again.\r\n\r\n**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**\r\n\r\nFYI, I’m going to be your new \\#1 supporter (scooch over parentals and/or besties). I encourage questions and open discussions, and will always respond promptly, even if it’s just to say I’ll give a more detailed response later. My first pass edit letter and comments may seem daunting (I love providing all sorts of feedback and generating ideas for new avenues to take in the narrative), but I’ll be there to help you through and it will make for an easier second pass! I do lean more toward email, but I am certainly open to video chatting.\r\n\r\n**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**\r\n\r\nObviously, we’re busy people. But communication is important, especially given the timeframe. Prompt responses and/or updates on your progress will help us both. Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions and always keep an open mind.\r\n\r\n**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**\r\n\r\nThere are hobbies outside of editing? Curiouser and curiouser. I like playing video games (casually), singing (badly), scrapbooking (messily), and baking (disasters). There’s also this thing called reading that sounds pretty fun.\r\n\r\n**What was your favorite show to binge watch in the last year?**\r\n\r\nToo many! Last year was a blur of baking shows. _Nailed It_ and _Sugar Rush_ are my favorites. I also watched all of _Derry Girls_ *twice* and the _Derry Girls_ episode of _The Great British Baking Show_. Needless to say, I adore them."
