  content: "##### Bio\r\n\r\nLeah Pierre is a literary agent at Ladderbird Literary Agency. She graduated with her bachelor's degree in English and History from Rosemont College and is currently pursuing her master's in Publishing. Though an agent, editing is her first love as she has always been dedicated to helping authors develop their stories and produce their best work.\r\n\r\n**Pronouns: She/Her**\r\n\r\n##### MSWL\r\n\r\nI love diverse and unique work that is fast paced and has a complex cast of diverse characters. I love a good plot twist and am a huge sucker for camaraderie, banter, and the tight-knit, family-like group of friends trope.\r\n\r\n**YA/Crossover/Adult:**\r\n * Fantasy\r\n * Romance\r\n * Mystery/Thriller/Suspense\r\n * Fairytale retellings/reimagining\r\n\r\nI love a good meet cute, coming of age, and self discovery story, especially in or post college. I'm pretty much a fan of all the tropes. I am here for the unreliable narrators. I'm also really interested in plots that deal with the struggles of today online dating culture, about how couples deal with growth and life pulling them in two different directions, or how society’s views can impact interracial relationships (this can also apply to platonic friendships as I think they are affected in the same ways). \r\n\r\n**No's** for me would be MG, sci-fi, dystopian, and non-fiction. I also don't want cliché romances where majority of the plot is cheating, parental disapproval, or high school drama. Give me something out of the ordinary, please. \r\n\r\n##### Q&A\r\n\r\n**How can a manuscript’s first five pages make you sit up and take notice?**\r\n\r\nI look for three things: voice, stakes, and worldbuilding. When the character's voice is really strong and is jumping off the page then I'm drawn in immediately. The stakes also need to be evident and extremely clear for me to understand the dynamic of what exactly I am getting into and rules of the world needs to be evident enough that I am not lost moving forward.\r\n\r\n**What can writers expect from working with you during #RevPit, including communication?**\r\n\r\nI'm dedicated to helping authors develop and produce their best work. I like to first look at the work as a whole and take stock of the big picture issues in terms of plot, character, worldbuilding, and organization. Then I like to go more in depth on each and brainstorm ways in which these aspects can be fleshed out and improved. \r\n\r\nPartnership is my favorite part of being an editor so I'm more than happy to set up a Zoom call to brainstorm, but on the day to day you can DM me for quick questions and email for more in-depth questions that may require some thought.\r\n\r\n**What do you expect from writers during the #RevPit revision process, including communication?**\r\n\r\nFlexibility, openness, and enthusiasm! They should be open to and willing to act on constructive criticism and feedback. They should also know what areas in which they both need and want improvement. It is going to take more than one round of editing to get your novel ready so someone who understands that and is is ready to get to work.\r\n\r\n**What hobbies do you have outside of writing and editing?**\r\n\r\nReading of course, haha! But in addition to that, I love crocheting, trying out new recipes, going for hikes, and catching up on all the TV/movies I'm behind on!\r\n\r\n**What was your favorite show to binge watch in the last year?**\r\n\r\n_Schitt's Creek_."
